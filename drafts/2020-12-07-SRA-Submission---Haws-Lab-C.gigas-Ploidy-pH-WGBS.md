I submitted the [24 _C.gigas_ diploid/triploid pH-treated WGBS sequence data we received 20201205](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2020/12/05/Data-Received-C.gigas-Diploid-Triploid-pH-Treatments-Ctenidia-WGBS-from-ZymoResearch.html) to the [NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra).

The samples were registered as part of the following BioProject:

- [PRJNA682817](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA682817)

This accession number is what should be referenced for any publications with these samples. This has been added to [`Nightingales`](https://b.link/nightingales) (Google Sheet), the Roberts Lab NGS database.

Here is a table which contains individual sample accession numbers, in case they're needed:
