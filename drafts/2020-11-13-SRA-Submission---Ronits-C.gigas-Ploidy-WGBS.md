A few days ago, [we received the whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WBGS) data (20201110)](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2020/11/10/Data-Received-C.gigas-Ploidy-WGBS-from-Ronits-Project-via-ZymoResearch.html) from [Ronit's _C.gigas_ diploid/triploid dessication/heat stress experiment (GitHub repo)](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas_ploidy).

Now, I need to get these submitted to the [NCBI short read archive (SRA)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra).
