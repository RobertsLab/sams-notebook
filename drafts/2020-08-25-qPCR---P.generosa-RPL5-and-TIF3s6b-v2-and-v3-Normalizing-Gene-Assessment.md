[After testing out the RPL5 and TIF3s6b v2 and v3 primers yesterday](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2020/08/24/qPCR-P.generosa-RPL5-v2-v3-and-TIF3s6b-v2-v3-Primer-Tests.html) on pooled cDNA, we determined the primers looked good, so will go forward testing them on a set of _P.generosa_ hemolymph [cDNA made by Kaitlyn on 20200212](https://genefish.wordpress.com/2020/02/12/kaitlyns-notebook-testing-new-primers-on-geoduck-hemolymph-rna/). This will evaluate whether or not these can be utilized as normalizing genes for subsequent gene expression analyses.


Primers used:

| SRID | Primer_Name    |
|------|----------------|
| 1787 | RPL5_v2_FWD    |
| 1786 | RPL5_v2_REV    |
| 1785 | RPL5_v3_FWD    |
| 1784 | RPL5_v3_REV    |
| 1783 | TIF3s6b_v2_FWD |
| 1782 | TIF3s6b_v2_REV |
| 1781 | TIF3s6b_v3_FWD |
| 1780 | TIF3s6b_v3_REV |

I used [geoduck gDNA (162ng/uL; from 20170105)](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2017/01/05/dna-isolation-geoduck-gdna-for-illumina-initiated-sequencing-project.html) as a positive control.

Master mix calcs are here:

All qPCR reactions were run in duplicate. See qPCR Report (Results section below) for plate layout, cycling params, etc.

NOTE: These qPCRs used the remainder of all the samples.
