[Steven assigned me to do some MBD-BSseq library prep](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/990) (GitHub Issue) for some Dungeness crab (_Metacarcinus magister_) DNA samples provided by Mackenzie Gavery. The DNA was isolated from juvenile (J6/J7 developmental stages) gill tissue. One of the first steps in MBD-BSseq is to fragment DNA to a desired size (~350 - 500bp in our case). However, we haven't worked with _Metacarcinus magister_ DNA previously, so I need to empirically determine sonicator (Bioruptor 300; Diagenode) settings for these samples.

I used 1ug of DNA in a volume of 50uL, using 0.65mL prelubricated snap cap tubes (Costar; Cat# 3206).

Initially, I just did a 35 cycle (30s ON, 30s OFF) run and determined it was insufficient, so ran increments of 5 cycles and pulled out 1.5uL after each one to run on the Bioanalyzer.

Samples were run on High Sensitivity DNA Assay chips in the Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent).
