[I previously ran some shearing tests on 20201022](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2020/10/22/DNA-Shearing-M.magister-CH05-21-gDNA-Full-Shearing-Test-and-Bioanalyzer.html) to determine how many cycles to run on the sonicator (Bioruptor 300; Diagenode) to achieve an average fragment length of ~350 - 500bp in preparation for MBD-BSseq. The determination was 70 cycles (30s ON, 30s OFF; low intensity), sonicating for 35 cycles, followed by successive rounds of 5 cycles each.

I used 1ug of DNA in a volume of 50uL, using 0.65mL prelubricated snap cap tubes (Costar; Cat# 3206).

Post-sonication/shearing, samples were run on High Sensitivity DNA Assay chips in the Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent).

All samples and volumes used are listed in the following Google Sheet (originally provided by Mackenzie Gavery):
