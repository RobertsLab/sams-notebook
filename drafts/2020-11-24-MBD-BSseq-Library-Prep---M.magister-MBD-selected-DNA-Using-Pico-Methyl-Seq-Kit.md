[After finishing the final set of eight MBD selections on 20201103](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2020/11/03/MBD-Selection-M.magister-Sheared-Gill-gDNA-16-of-24-Samples-Set-3-of-3.html), I'm finally ready to make the BSseq libraries using the [Pico Methyl-Seq Library Prep Kit (ZymoResearch)](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/blob/master/protocols/Commercial_Protocols/ZymoResearch_PicoMethylseq.pdf) (PDF). I followed the manufacturer's protocols with the following notes/changes (organized by each section in the protocol):

##### GENERAL

- All thermalcycling was performed on the Roberts Lab PTC-200 (MJ Research).

- All thermalcycling used a heated lid temp of 104<sup>o</sup>C, unless a different temp was specified in the protocol.

- All elution steps were performed with heated elution buffer (55<sup>o</sup>C).

##### SECTION 2

- PrepAmp Mix was prepared as a master mix and then distributed to samples as required
