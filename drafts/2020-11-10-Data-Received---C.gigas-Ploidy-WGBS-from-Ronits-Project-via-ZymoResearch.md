We received the data from our [whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) submission to ZymoResearch on 2020820](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2020/08/20/Samples-Submitted-Ronits-C.gigas-Diploid-and-Triploid-Ctenidia-to-ZymoResearch-for-WGBS.html) for Ronit's _C.gigas_ diploid/triploid dessication/heat stress project.

Samples were sequenced using 150bp paired-end, on the Illumina NovaSeq.

Files have been added to [the C.gigas folder in nightingales on Owl (Synology server)](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/C_gigas/).

I've updated the [nightingales Google Sheet database as well](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_XqIOPVHSBVGscnjzDSWUeRL7HUHXfaHxVzec-I-8Xk/edit?usp=sharing).

Next up:

- Run FatQC

- Submit to NCBI sequence read archive (SRA).
