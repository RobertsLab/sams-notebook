Isolated some gDNA from the [triploid Nisbet oysters we received on 20200218](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2018/02/28/samples-received-triploid-crassostrea-gigas-from-nisbet-oyster-company.html) and one of [Ronit's diploid ctenidia samples](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QfEV4wUp3jgChxHhpaYsVswZEem3t3uQATNk4bB_XIU/edit) (Google Sheet) using the E.Z.N.A. Mollusc DNA Kit (Omega). See the "Results" section for sample info.

Samples were pulverized under liquid nitrogen (LN2). Samples were _not_ weighed beforehand; simply "eye-balled" pieces to get close to ~30 - 50mg. [Manufacturer's protocol](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/blob/master/protocols/Commercial_Protocols/Omega_Mollusc-DNA-Kit-Combo-May-2013-D3373.pdf) (PDF) was followed with the following notes/changes:

- Proteinase K was _not_ from kit (seem to be out). Instead was ThermoFisher brand (stored in -20C) with a concentration of ~20mg/mL and expiration date of September 2019.

- eluted in 100uL of elution buffer

DNA was quantified using the Roberts Lab Qubit 3.0 using the dsDNA BR Assay (Invitrogen) and 1uL of each sample.
