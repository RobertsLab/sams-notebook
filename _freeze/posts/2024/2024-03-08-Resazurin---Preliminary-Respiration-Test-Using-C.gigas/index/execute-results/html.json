GitHub repo is [here](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-carryover). As part of that, Steven recently found out about a protocol to easily evaluate respiration in oysters using [resazurin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resazurin) (Wikipedia). According to [@gonzález-pinzón2012], the reduction of resazurin to resorufin is almost perfectly correlated with respiration in aerobic bacteria and, thus, can be used as a proxy to measure respiration. Offhand, I have not looked at literature detailing its use with eukaryotic cells - I just glanced at the literature cited by Wikipedia. :)\n\nIdeally, using this method would provide a quick, cheap, and wasy way for us and hatcheries to monitor respiration in live oysters, with the potential to use the method as a means to detect stress-inducing events.\n\nFor this initial test, I followed the [resazurin assay](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-carryover/blob/27441a713dfe68578758103bb82dd4dca4b4c091/protocols/Resazurin-assay.md) (commit 27441a7) shared by Steven, with the following modifications:\n\n- Non-sterile water/sea water was used.\n\n- No penn/strep/Fungizone used.\n\nSmall oysters were distributed by Steven in two, 12-well (3x4) plates, and covered completely with 2mL of resazurin Assay Media:\n\n- unstressed\n\n  - Oysters were in all 12 wells.\n\n- heat stressed (not sure what the temp or duration was)\n\n  - Well C4 (bottom right) contained no oysters.\n\nTwo larger oyster which would not fit in the 12-well plates were each placed in a glass Petri dish and covered with 20mL of resazurin Assay Media.\n\n\n::: {layout-nrow=\"3\"}\n![unstressed oysters in 12-well plate](20240307-unstressed-oysters-plate_01.jpg)\n\n![unstressed oysters in 12-well plate submerged in 2mL resazurin Assay Media](20240307-unstressed-oysters-plate_01-resazurin_2mL.jpg)\n\n![heat stressed oysters in 12-well plate](20240307-hs-oysters-plate_01.jpg)\n\n![heat stressed oysters in 12-well plate submerged in 2mL resazurin Assay Media](20240307-hs-oysters-plate_01-resazurin_2mL.jpg)\n\n![unstressed oysters in glass Petri dishes](20240307-unstressed-oysters-dish_01.jpg)\n\n![unstressed oysters in glass Petri dishes submerged in 20mL resazurin Assay Media](20240307-dish_01-resazurin_20mL.jpg)\n:::\n\nFluorescence was mesasured on a Victor 1420 (Perkin Elmer) plate reader. Plates were read directly, with the oysters in them. For the Petri dishes, 2mL were transferred from each into wells of a new 12-well plate and measured.\n\n# RESULTS\n\nOverall, it seems like there was a difference in fluorescence between resazurin control wells (i.e. resazurin assay media only) and wells which contained oysters. So, it appears that the assay is working. Admittedly, I'm a bit surprised by how dark the assay media is. I'd definitely like to play around with the amount resazurin being used, as I think less resazurin might allow us to visually identify differences, in addition to collecting fluorescence readings.\n\n## Output files\n\nAll files have been added to [https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-carryover/blob/main/lifestage_carryover/data/resazurin_trial_01/](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-carryover/blob/main/lifestage_carryover/data/resazurin_trial_01/).\n\n- [`20240307-cgig-resazurin-control-bigs-and-two-controls-t2.0.xlsx`](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-carryover/edit/main/lifestage_carryover/data/resazurin_trial_01/20240307-cgig-resazurin-control-bigs-and-two-controls-t2.0.xlsx): Raw data file (Excel workbook) from Victor (Perkin Elmer) Wallac plate reader of fluorescence measurements of 2mL resazurin assay media from oysters in glass petri dishes after two hours.
