When I arrived, Gannet appeared to be powered on and the \"Status\" light was green, but none of the drive light indicators were on.\n\n![Blue power indicator is illuminated, however, all drive lights are out.](./20241118-gannet-hdds-no_lights.jpg){#fig-no_lights fig-alt=\"Blue power indicator is illuminated, however, all drive lights are out.\" .lightbox}\n\nWith no other recourse, I powered off Gannet and then powered it back on. All drive lights illuminated, with one of them red, indicating that drive had failed.\n\n![All drive lights are green, except one, which is red.](./20241118-gannet-hdds-red_light.jpg){#fig-one_red_light fig-alt=\"All drive lights are green, except one, which is red.\" .lightbox}\n\nI was then able to access the Synology DSM web interface, removed the bad drive from the storage pool, physically replaced the bad drive, and added the new drive to the storage pool.\n\n\n![Screenshot of Synology DSM showing all drives as healthy and pool is in repair mode.](./20241118-gannet-hdd-replacement-repairing-01.png){#fig-dsm_repair_mode fig-alt=\"Screenshot of Synology DSM showing all drives as healthy and pool is in repair mode.\" .lightbox}\n\nEverything looks good now, but it's not clear why Synology marked the drive as bad. Quick S.M.A.R.T. tests run on Synology and using Seagate's [SeaTools](https://www.seagate.com/support/downloads/seatools/) indicated the drive was fine...\n\nI'll run an extended test using [SeaTools](https://www.seagate.com/support/downloads/seatools/) to see if that reports anything different.\n",
