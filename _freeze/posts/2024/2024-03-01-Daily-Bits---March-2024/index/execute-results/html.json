Discussed approaches for writing manuscripts to try to overcome writer's block and/or motivation.\n\n## 20240314\n\n### Lab Meeting\n\n- Discussed 2nd half of \"Tending Sweetgrass\" in \"Braiding Sweetgrass\"\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\n- Finished [notebook entry](../2024-03-12-Resazurin---C.gigas-Second-Trial/index.qmd) for 2nd resazuring trial (a lot of frustrations with ChatGPT on the computation side of things...).\n\n### [CEABIGR](https://github.com/sr320/ceabigr) (GitHub repo)\n\n- Worked on manuscript.\n\n\n## 20240312\n\n### In Lab\n\n- Conducted 2nd [resazurin trial](../2024-03-12-Resazurin---C.gigas-Second-Trial/index.qmd) (Notebook).\n\n## 20240311\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\n- Directed Azenta to post invoices to UW Workday system.\n\n- Added initial resazurin trial [README.md](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-carryover/blob/main/lifestage_carryover/data/resazurin_trial_01/REAMDE.md) to the [`project-gigas-carryover` repo](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-carryover).\n\n### [CEABIGR](https://github.com/sr320/ceabigr) (GitHub repo)\n\n- Began transferring sequencing data to NCBI.\n\n## 20240308\n\n### [Coral E5](https://github.com/urol-e5/deep-dive) (GitHub repo)\n\n- Reviewed manuscript with Steven.\n\n### Miscellnaeous\n\n- Finished up more ProCard stuff.\n\n## 20240307\n\n### In lab\n\n- Ran initial [resazurin test](../2024-03-08-Resazurin---Preliminary-Respiration-Test-Using-C.gigas/index.qmd) (Notebook) on some small [_Crassostrea gigas_ (Pacific oyster)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_oyster) oysters provided by Steven.\n\n- [Lab meeting](https://otter.ai/u/POqgTdepVCnVErcUQoH_vcS82AE?utm_source=copy_url). (Otter AI summary)\n\n- Received chemicals for resazuring assay. Got those entered into MyChem and entered into Workday.\n\n## 20240306\n\n### [CEABIGR](https://github.com/sr320/ceabigr) (GitHub repo)\n\n- Lengthy meeting to work extensively on manuscript - primarily documenting where code/data came from and organizing repo.\n\n## 20240305\n\n- Dealt with a bunch of annoying ProCard reconciliation stuff.\n\n## 20240304\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\n- Read the rest of \"Tending Sweetgrass\" section in \"Braiding Sweetgrass\".\n\n- Dealt with certificate issues for Eagle and Gannet. Despite \"renewing\" them, the renewal \"broke\" `wget` (can no longer download _without_ the use of `--no-check-certificate` flag). Remembered that I'd had this issue before and tracked down a [notebook entry](../../2022/2022-04-02-Server-Maintenance---Fix-Server-Certificate-Authentication-Issues/index.qmd) that dealt with this issue. Needed to install intermediate certificates and that resolved the problem!\n\n## 20240301\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\n- Renewed Eagle server SSL certificate.\n\n- Renewed Gannet server SSL certificate.\n\n- Science Hour\n\n  - Steven out of town, no show by anyone else.\n\n### [CEABIGR](https://github.com/sr320/ceabigr) (GitHub repo)\n\n- Updated README files.\n",
