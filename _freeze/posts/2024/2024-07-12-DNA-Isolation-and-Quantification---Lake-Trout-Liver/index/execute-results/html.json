Liver tissues had been stored @ -20<sup>o</sup>C in RNALater (Ambion). I thawed the tubes, transferred the entire liver tissue (which was very small) to a disposable mortar/pestle combo (1.5mL tube) and homogenized. DNA was eventually eluted with 50uL of Elution Buffer.\n\nSubsequently, DNA was quantified using the 1x dsDNA Broad Range Qubit Assay (ThermoFisher). One microliter of sample was combined with 199uL of the dye/buffer mix and measured on a Qubit 3.0.\n\nDNA was stored in a box labelled \"Lake Trout Liver gDNA\" in the FTR 209 -20<sup>o</sup>C freezer.\n\n\n# RESULTS\n\n## Qubit data\n\n- [20240712-snam-qubit-DNA.br-liver.csv](./20240712-snam-qubit-DNA.br-liver.csv)\n\n\n| sample_ID | Original sample conc.
