Due to their length, low complexity, and low melting temperatures (T<sub>m</sub>) I opted to test these out on a pool of the [_Salvelinus namaycush_ gDNA isolated on 20240712](../2024-07-12-DNA-Isolation-and-Quantification---Lake-Trout-Liver/index.qmd), using a temperature gradient.\n\n## MATERIALS & METHODS\n\n### DNA Pooling\n\n1uL of each sample was used to create a pool of gDNA.\n\n### PCR Reactions\n\nPCR reactions were run using [EpiMark Hot Start Taq DNA Polymerase](https://www.neb.com/en-us/products/m0490-epimark-hot-start-taq-dna-polymerase) (New England Biolabs), according to the [manufacturer's protocol](https://www.neb.com/en-us/protocols/2012/09/25/epimark-hot-start-taq-dna-polymerase-guidelines-for-pcr-reactions-m0490), in a total reaction volume of 25uL. Since all samples were the same, the equivalent of 1uL of DNA per reaction was added directly to the master mix. The master mix was then distributed to 0.1mL PCR plates and run on a CFX Connect (BioRad) thermalcycler.\n\nI tested three different annealing temps (45<sup>o</sup>C, 50<sup>o</sup>C, and 55<sup>o</sup>C).\n\n### PCR Cycling\n\nAnnealing temperature gradient PCR was performed in a CFX Connect (BioRad).\n\nCycling params:\n\n\n![Screenshot of cycling program, also sdhowing temperature gradient.](./20240911-snam-bs-pcr-gradient-range.png){#fig-PCR-parameters fig-alt=\"PCR cycling parameters.\"}\n\n\n1. 95<sup>o</sup>C - 30s\n2. 95<sup>o</sup>C - 15s\n3. 45 - 55<sup>o</sup>C - 20s\n4. 68<sup>o</sup>C - 4m\n5. Go to Step 2 x 39.\n6. 68<sup>o</sup>C - 5m\n7. 4<sup>o</sup>C - FOREVER \n\nSamples were loaded in the following positions:\n\n![PCR tube placement in thermacylcer](./20240911-snam-bs-pcr-thermalcyler-block.jpg){#fig-tubes fig-alt=\"Tube placement in thermalcylcer.\"}\n\nPCR reactions were loaded on a low-TAE, 1.0% agarose gel, with ethidium bromide. Gel was run at 107V for ~45mins and then imaged.\n\nO'GeneRuler (ThermoFisher) Ladder was used (5uL) for size reference:\n\n![Ladder](../../../images/ogene-ruler.jpeg){#fig-ladder fig-alt=\"O'GeneRuler\" .lightbox}\n\n## RESULTS\n\nNo amplification.\n\n\n![Agarose gel showing no amplificaiton in any of the three annealing temp of 45<sup>o</sup>C, 50<sup>o</sup>C, and 55<sup>o</sup>C](./20240911-snam-bs-pcr-gel.jpg){#fig-gel fig-alt=\"Agarose gel showing no amplificaiton in any of the three annealing temps.\"}\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nWell, that's a bummer. Will design some regular PCR primers to see if we can succussfully PCR the C1q gene from the original gDNA (i.e. _not_ bisulfite converted DNA).\n",
