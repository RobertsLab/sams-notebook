Oligo dT primers and M-MLV reverse transcriptase amounts were adjusted to maintain the proper ratio, relative to the amount of input RNA.\n\n## Calculations:\n\n- [20240319-cgig-carryover-spat-seed-cDNA-calcs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b8Dh9winK2Q_3SVx-E1EnYkeyjDga3tWWNRCE_nEPmQ/edit?usp=sharing) (Google Sheet)\n\n# RESULTS\n\ncDNA was stored in the -20<sup>o</sup>C freezer in FTR 213.\n\nBox layout:\n\n- [Lifestage Carryover C.gigas cDNA Box 1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dH1nrwITQwoYXUFSNx0-dHIjquq_Pde11pJ3Hz7K1Xc/edit#gid=1927399671)\n\n![Box with blue label: \"Lifestage Carryover, C.gigas cDNA Box #1\"](20240319-cDNA-box.jpg){fig-alt=\"Box with blue label: Lifestage Carryover, C.gigas cDNA Box #1\"}\n\n\n\n",
