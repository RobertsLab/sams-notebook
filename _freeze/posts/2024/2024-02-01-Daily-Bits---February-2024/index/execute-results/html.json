Definitely a few individuals whose exon usage seems to deviate a great deal from that WGCNA module assignment...\n\n### [Coral E5](https://github.com/urol-e5/deep-dive) (GitHub repo)\n\n- Continued to work on implementing new trimming/merging parameters, but [ShortStack](https://github.com/MikeAxtell/ShortStack/tree/master) keeps encountering an [error](https://github.com/MikeAxtell/ShortStack/issues/146) (GitHub Issue). I'm hoping the developer can lend some insight. This is weird, because these samples, albeit trimmed with a different program and used as paired-end reads (only trying R1 or merged reads at this point), were successfully analyzed previously...\n\n## 20240208\n\n### Lab meeting\n\n### [CEABIGR](https://github.com/sr320/ceabigr) (GitHub repo)\n\n- Special, extended session with Arianna in attendance. She ran some [WGCNA](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/WGCNA/WGCNA.pdf) (PDF) analysis to try to see how exon expression patterns varied between control/exposed samples. Very cool!\n\n## 20240207\n\n### [Coral E5](https://github.com/urol-e5/deep-dive) (GitHub repo)\n\n- Finished messing around with trimming/merging stuff. Here's the [notebook entry](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/posts/2024/2024-02-02-sRNA-seq-Paired-Read-Merging-Exploratios---Coral-E5-Deep-Dive/).\n\n- Began implementing new trimming/merging.\n\n## 20240206\n\n### [Coral E5](https://github.com/urol-e5/deep-dive) (GitHub repo)\n\n- Continued to explore trimming and merging strategies for sRNA-seq data, using [`fastp`](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp) alone, BBMerge alone, and/or combining the two approaches.\n\n### [CEABIGR](https://github.com/sr320/ceabigr) (GitHub repo)\n\n- Spent a few hours on a video chat with Steven and Yaamini going through exon fold-change code/analysis.\n\n## 20240205\n\n### [Coral E5](https://github.com/urol-e5/deep-dive) (GitHub repo)\n\n- Continued to explore trimming and merging strategies for sRNA-seq data, using [`fastp`](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp) alone, BBMerge alone, and/or combining the two approaches.\n\n## 20240202\n\n### [Coral E5](https://github.com/urol-e5/deep-dive) (GitHub repo)\n\n### Science Hour\n\n- Steven and I played around with exon fold-change data.\n\n## 20240201\n\n### In Lab\n\n-   Lab meeting.\n\n-   Helped Eric get started with RNA quantification using Qubit.\n\n### [Coral E5](https://github.com/urol-e5/deep-dive) (GitHub repo)\n\n- Tested out more R1/R2 merging/trimming using [`fastp`](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp).\n\n  - Merging is similar to BBMerge results - i.e. a (relatively) small number of reads are actually merging, despite the fact that these should be short insert sizes and R1/R2 reads should overlap...\n\n-   Installed [XICRA](https://github.com/HCGB-IGTP/XICRA) [@sanchezherrero2021] on Raven to identify isomiRs in sRNA-seq data. Possibly to get around the merging \"issues\" experienced with BBMerge and [`fastp`](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp).\n\n    -   Installation was a bit bumpy, due to some weird Conda/Mamba \"flexible solve\" problem, but got that straightened out with `conda config --set channel_priority flexible`.\n\n    -   Installation test(s) had issues. I created the following GitHub Issues on the developer's site in hopes of getting help:\n\n      - [`installer.sh error`](https://github.com/HCGB-IGTP/XICRA/issues/47)\n\n      - [\"No samples were retrieved\" in test data](https://github.com/HCGB-IGTP/XICRA/issues/42)\n\n\n### [CEABIGR](https://github.com/sr320/ceabigr) (GitHub repo)\n\n- Need to generate R<sup>2</sup> values and slope of exon expression for all genes, Exons 1 - 6.\n",
