All files were downloaded and [MD5 checksums were verified](#checksum-verification). Raw FastQ files are available here:\n\n- https://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/S_pacificus/30-1067895835/\n\nAzenta report (HTML):\n\n- [https://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/S_pacificus/30-1067895835/Azenta_30-1067895835_Data_Report.html](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/S_pacificus/30-1067895835/Azenta_30-1067895835_Data_Report.html)\n\nSequencing yielded:\n\n`1B3`: ~38.7M reads\n\n`2B1`: ~28.6M reads\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nThese were sequenced as an add-on to the sample plate of a different, larger project ([Coral E5 time series](https://github.com/urol-e5/timeseries_molecular) (GitHub Repo)). As such, the Azenta report contains sequencing information for a large number of unrelated samples.\n:::\n\n# CHECKSUM VERIFICATION\n\n![Screenshot of MD5 checksum verifications. ](./20241230-spac-WGBS-30-1067895835-checksums-01.png){#fig-MD5-01 fig-alt=\"Screenshot of MD5 checksum verifications.\" .lightbox}",
