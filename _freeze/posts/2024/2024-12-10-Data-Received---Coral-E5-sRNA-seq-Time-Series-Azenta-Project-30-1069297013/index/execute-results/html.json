All files were downloaded and [MD5 checksums were verified](#checksum-verification). Raw FastQ files are available here:\n\n- https://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/E5-coral-time-series/30-1069297013/\n\nAzenta report (HTML):\n\n- https://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/E5-coral-time-series/30-1069297013/Azenta_30-1069297013_Data_Report.html\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nFrom Azenta:\n> Nine samples (1H2, 1G3, 1H3, 1C12, 1B6, 1H1, 1A11, 1F7, and 1F10) fell short of the quoted read counts. An attempt to re-sequence them was unsuccessful. Billing for the project will be adjusted appropriately.\n:::\n\nInterestingly, these nine samples are _not_ listed in the Azenta Report. I've reached out to Azenta to see what's going on.\n\nAlso, there were a number of files which had relatively low yields; <8M paired reads. These were samples which failed Azenta's initial QC and we told them to proceed with \"best effort.\"\n\n::: {.callout-important}\nAll samples listed below are from the _Porites sp._\n:::\n\n```\n2E3   890\n1C11  8646\n100   18202\n2H1   30540\n1B3   91508\n2F2   213674\n1C6   290780\n1B7   539520\n1E7   542344\n1D12  629354\n1F1   873692\n1H2   2343346\n1G3   3254010\n1H3   3763428\n1C12  4487588\n2A3   4864990\n1B6   5025998\n2D3   6075878\n1H1   6377338\n1A11  6478178\n1F7   7215308\n```\n\n\n\n# CHECKSUM VERIFICATION\n\n![Screenshot of MD5 checksum verifications. ](./20241210-E5-timeseries-sRNAseq-checksums-01.png){#fig-MD5-01 fig-alt=\"Screenshot of MD5 checksum verifications.\" .lightbox}\n\n![Screenshot of MD5 checksum verifications. ](./20241210-E5-timeseries-sRNAseq-checksums-02.png){#fig-MD5-02 fig-alt=\"Screenshot of MD5 checksum verifications.\" .lightbox}\n\n![Screenshot of MD5 checksum verifications. ](./20241210-E5-timeseries-sRNAseq-checksums-03.png){#fig-MD5-03 fig-alt=\"Screenshot of MD5 checksum verifications.\" .lightbox}\n\n![Screenshot of MD5 checksum verifications. ](./20241210-E5-timeseries-sRNAseq-checksums-04.png){#fig-MD5-04 fig-alt=\"Screenshot of MD5 checksum verifications.\" .lightbox}\n\n![Screenshot of MD5 checksum verifications. ](./20241210-E5-timeseries-sRNAseq-checksums-05.png){#fig-MD5-05 fig-alt=\"Screenshot of MD5 checksum verifications.\" .lightbox}\n",
