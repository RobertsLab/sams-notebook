FastA headers do _not_ contain SwissProt IDs, Thus, they don't end up in the final annotation report file.\n\n  - Considering \"custom\" BLASTp database created from the full UniProt protein FastA, since I belive the [`Trinotate`](https://github.com/Trinotate/Trinotate/wiki) parsing is based on column numbers in the BLASTp output format 6 (which would contain the SwisProt IDs), as opposed to specifically parsing specifically formatted strings within that output format.\n\n### Singularity Containers\n\n- Related to above, started to explore the use of containers - specifically the [`Trinotate`](https://github.com/Trinotate/Trinotate/wiki) Singularity image.\n\n  - Most confusing aspect is the fact that there are two programs which cannot be included with [`Trinotate`](https://github.com/Trinotate/Trinotate/wiki), due to licensing issues:\n\n    - `signalp6`\n    - `tmhmmv2`\n\n    The main question: How do I access/run these programs if they're not in the container? To do so, I downloaded/installed them on Raven and then I added them to the container's system `$PATH` when starting the container, like so:\n\n    ```bash\n    singularity shell -e \\\n    --env PREPEND_PATH=\"/home/sam/programs/mambaforge/envs/singalp6_env/bin:/home/shared/tmhmm-2.0c/bin:/home/shared/infernal-1.1.5-linux-intel-gcc/binaries:/home/shared/hmmer-3.4/src\" \\\n    /home/shared/containers/trinotate.v4.0.2.simg\n    ```\n\n    This appended the programs on my computer to the beginning of the container's system `$PATH`, thus allowing these programs to be called.\n\n  - Another confusing aspect was how to access locations on my local computer once I was in the container. For example, the user's `$HOME` directory is mounted/bound (i.e. accessible) by default. However, I also needed access to `/home/shared`, but I didn't want to bind this to a directory within the container because then it would superseded the contents of the specified directory in the container. Since I wasn't terribly familiar with the container's structure, nor how to add a directory when starting the container image, I managed to figure out that the current directory from which the user starts the container image is automatically bound. So, I navigated to `/home/shared` first, then started the container with the command shown above. This permitted me to access `/home/shared` and all its subdirectories.\n\n## 20240426\n\n### [DuMOAR](https://github.com/laurahspencer/DuMOAR) (GitHub repo)\n\n- Continued to look into [`Trinotate`](https://github.com/Trinotate/Trinotate/wiki) annotation [issue where BLASTp results do _not_ have SwissProt IDs(https://github.com/laurahspencer/DuMOAR/issues/44#issuecomment-1977588065)].\n\n  - Started to explore newer version of [`Trinotate`](https://github.com/Trinotate/Trinotate/wiki) to see if the issue could be resolved.\n\n## 20240425\n\n### [DuMOAR](https://github.com/laurahspencer/DuMOAR) (GitHub repo)\n\n- Started to look into [`Trinotate`](https://github.com/Trinotate/Trinotate/wiki) annotation [issue where BLASTp results do _not_ have SwissProt IDs(https://github.com/laurahspencer/DuMOAR/issues/44#issuecomment-1977588065)].\n\n## 20240424\n\n### [Coral E5](https://github.com/urol-e5/deep-dive) (GitHub repo)\n\n- Finished up _P.meandrina_ [`miRDeep2`](https://github.com/rajewsky-lab/mirdeep2) with cnidarian miRBase.\n\n## 20240423\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\n- [Resolved degarded storage pool issue with Gannet](../2024-04-23-Computer-Troubleshooting---Gannet-Missing-Storage-Pool/index.qmd).\n\n## 20240422\n\n### [Coral E5](https://github.com/urol-e5/deep-dive) (GitHub repo)\n\n- Worked on _P.meandrina_ stuff:\n\n  - BLASTn with cnidarin miRBase.\n  - [`miRDeep2`](https://github.com/rajewsky-lab/mirdeep2) with cnidarian miRBase.\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\n- ProCard reconcilation junk.\n\n## 20240402\n\n### In lab\n\n- [Filled LN<sub>2</sub> dry shipper and dewar for Arianna](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/1861) (GitHub Issue).\n\n- [Showed Zach how to use the plate reader](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/1860) (GitHub Issue).\n\n### [Coral E5](https://github.com/urol-e5/deep-dive) (GitHub repo)\n\n- Worked on running pipeline for _A.pulchra_ with agreed upon trimming/merging params.\n\n## 20240401\n\n### [CEABIGR](https://github.com/sr320/ceabigr) (GitHub repo)\n\n- Looked up [Freebayes parameters](https://github.com/sr320/ceabigr/issues/109) (GitHub Issue).\n\n### [Coral E5](https://github.com/urol-e5/deep-dive) (GitHub repo)\n\n- Worked on running pipeline for _A.pulchra_ with agreed upon trimming/merging params.\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\n- [Submitted PO request for cod WGBS at Psomagen](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/1786) (GitHub Issue).\n",
