However, [Laura realized that there was a large discrepancy between the amount of reads returned between samples](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/1904) (GitHub Issue). Additionally, the quote for this project indicated a minimum of 20M reads/sample and many were below that threshold. I contacted Azenta and, after having to ping them a _lot_, they finally re-sequenced the samples.\n\nI downloaded to Owl and confirmed that data integrity was good via MD5 checksums:\n\n![MD5 checksum verification for first set of files.](./20240909-gmac-supplemental-rnaseq-checksums-01.png){#fig-md5-checksums-01 fig-alt=\"MD5 checksum verification for first set of files.\"}\n\n![MD5 checksum verification for second set of files.](./20240909-gmac-supplemental-rnaseq-checksums-02.png){#fig-md5-checksums-02 fig-alt=\"MD5 checksum verification for second set of files.\"}\n\nData is here:\n\nhttps://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/G_macrocephalus/30-943133806/supplemental/\n\nAzenta report is here:\n\nhttps://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/G_macrocephalus/30-943133806/supplemental/Azenta_30-943133806-TS01_Data_Report.html\n\nAdmittedly, I'm not entirely sure how to handle adding this to our [Nightingales Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_XqIOPVHSBVGscnjzDSWUeRL7HUHXfaHxVzec-I-8Xk/edit?usp=sharing). I'd like to maintain the provenance of the data, but it would probably make the most sense to concatenate each of the correspoding FastQs and document them in that fashion. I'll discuss with Steven and then decide.\n",
