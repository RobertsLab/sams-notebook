I [designed PCR primers for the C1Q gene on 20240916](../2024-09-16-Primer-Design---Lake-Trout-C1q-Gene-Sequencing-Primers-Using-Primer3/index.qmd), I decided to evaluate [_Salvelinus namaycush_ gDNA integrity isolated on 20240712](../2024-07-12-DNA-Isolation-and-Quantification---Lake-Trout-Liver/index.qmd) to see if the DNA was degraded (or not).\n\n# MATERIALS & METHODS\n\nSamples were run on 1.0% agarose, low-TAE gel with ethidium bromide. I prepared the DNA for loading by combining 0.5uL of each sample with 19.5uL of 1x TE, and 4uL of [6x Orange DNA Loading Dye (Thermo Scientific)](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/R0631). The gel was run @ 107V for ~45mins and then imaged.\n\n[O'GeneRuler DNA Ladder Mix, Ready-to-Use 100-10,00bp (Thermo Scientific)](https://www.fishersci.se/shop/products/fermentas-o-generuler-ready-to-use-dna-ladder-mix/11803983) was used (5uL) for size reference:\n\n![Ladder](../../../images/ogene-ruler.jpeg){#fig-ladder fig-alt=\"O'GeneRuler\" .lightbox}\n\n# RESULTS\n\nWell, there's no visible DNA on the gel. This suggests that an insufficient amount of DNA was loaded. The reason this is the best explanation is that even if the DNA were degraded, we'd still expect to see smearing, which would reflect degradation. Instead, we don't see anything.\n\n![Agarose gel showing no visible bands.](./20240925-snam-liver-gDNA-gel.jpg){#fig-ladder fig-alt=\"Agarose gel showing no visible bands.\" .lightbox}\n\n# DISCUSSION\n\nNot sure exactly why this might be, as [quantification would indicate the use of 0.5uL of each sample should yield more than enough to visualize on a gel (~100ng is usually sufficient for visualization)](../2024-07-12-DNA-Isolation-and-Quantification---Lake-Trout-Liver/index.qmd) (Notebook entry).",
