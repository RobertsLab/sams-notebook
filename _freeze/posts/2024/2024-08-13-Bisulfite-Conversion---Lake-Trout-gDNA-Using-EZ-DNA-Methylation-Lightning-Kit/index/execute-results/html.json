Samples were eluted with 10uL of the M-Elution Buffer and stored @ -20<sup>o</sup>C in the same box as the source DNA.\n\nCalculations for input DNA volumes are here:\n\n[20240813-snam-bs.dna-calcs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13kGo20L3vEQiW_IIanbSdNvWsF6MTpJJfbcqSZ5DctU/edit?usp=sharing) (Google Sheet)\n\n# DICUSSION\n\nNext step will be to perform qPCR to amplify the C1q gene using the [primers designed on 20240729](../2024-07-29-Primer-Design---Lake-Trout-C1q-Gene-Bisulfite-Sequencing-Primers-Using-Primer3/) (Notebook), for eventual sequencing.\n",
