Files were downloaded to Owl and [MD5 checksums were verified](#md5-checksum-verification). The [`Nightingales`](https://b.link/nightingales) (Google Sheet) spreadsheet has been updated with sample info.\n\nAll data is available here:\n\n- [https://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/G_macrocephalus/30-943133806/](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/G_macrocephalus/30-943133806/)\n\nNext steps are to run initial [`FastQC`](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/), as well as get them submitted to NCBI.\n\n\n# MD5 CHECKSUM VERIFICATION\n\n::: {layout-nrow=\"2\"}\n![](md5-checksum-verification-01.png){fig-alt=\"Screenshot showing MD5 checksum verification of FastQ files.\"}\n\n![](md5-checksum-verification-02.png){fig-alt=\"Screenshot showing MD5 checksum verification of FastQ files.\"}\n\n![](md5-checksum-verification-03.png){fig-alt=\"Screenshot showing MD5 checksum verification of FastQ files.\"}\n\n![](md5-checksum-verification-04.png){fig-alt=\"Screenshot showing MD5 checksum verification of FastQ files.\"}\n:::\n",
