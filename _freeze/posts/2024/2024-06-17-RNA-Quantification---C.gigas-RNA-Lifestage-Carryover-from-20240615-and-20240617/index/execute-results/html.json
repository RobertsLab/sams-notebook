The full list of all samples needing processing is here:\n\n- [`20240508_rna_extractions.csv`](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-carryover/blob/main/lifestage_carryover/data/sampling_metadata/20240508_rna_extractions.csv)\n\nI previously isolated RNA on [20240615](../2024-06-15-RNA-Isolation---C.gigas-Lifestage-Carryover-Seed-Juvenile-Adult/index.qmd) (Notebook) and [20240617](../2024-06-17-RNA-Isolation---C.gigas-Lifestage-Carryover-Seed-Juvenile-and-Adult/index.qmd) and needed to quantify them.\n\n# RNA Quantification\nRNA was quantified with the Roberts Lab Qubit 3.0 fluorometer (Invitrogen). Samples were quantified with the Qubit RNA High Sensitivity (HS) assay (Invitrogen). 1uL of sample was used for the assay(s).\n\n# RESULTS\n\nRaw Qubit data is here:\n\n- [`20240617-cgig-qubit-RNA.hs-carryover.csv`](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-carryover/blob/main/lifestage_carryover/data/qubit/20240617-cgig-qubit-RNA.hs-carryover.csv) (GitHub)\n\n\n\n| sample_ID | Original sample conc.
