Seems like this won't work, on either front!\n\n## 20240130\n\n### Miscellaneous Lab Stuff\n\n- Helped Chris troubleshoot her SOD assay standard curve. She felt like her samples SOD activity was too low and falling outside of the standard curve.\n\n  - Tried to evaluate BCA results - no raw data, though.\n\n  - Looked through the SOD protocol.\n\n  - Confirmed that her samples fell within the standard curve of the SOD assay and that everything was A-OK!\n\n- Went to eye doctor, eyes dilated, and couldn't see/read anything for the rest of the day!\n\n### [Coral E5](https://github.com/urol-e5/deep-dive) (GitHub repo)\n\n- Continued to explore sRNA-seq read trimming options.\n\n## 20240129\n\n### [CEABIGR](https://github.com/sr320/ceabigr) (GitHub repo)\n\n- Did more work on exon stuff.\n\n### [Coral E5](https://github.com/urol-e5/deep-dive) (GitHub repo)\n\n- Read through a few papers about sRNA-seq trimming/analyses.\n\n## 20240126\n\n### Science Hour\n\n\n- Worked on more [CEABIGR](https://github.com/sr320/ceabigr) (GitHub repo) exon stuff with Steven.\n\n## 20240125\n\n### Lab Meeting\n\n- Read Ch.5 of \"Race After Technology\"\n\n### [CEABIGR](https://github.com/sr320/ceabigr) (GitHub repo)\n\n- Weekly meeting.\n\n- Explored exon coverage with Steven.\n\n## 20240124\n\n### [CEABIGR](https://github.com/sr320/ceabigr) (GitHub repo)\n\n- Implemented exon sum threshold [to update ln(fold change vs Exon 1) determinations](../2024-01-24-Figure-Updates---CEABIGR-Spurious-Transcription-Calcs-and-Plotting-Using-Exon-Sum-Threshold/index.qmd) (Notebook).\n\n## 20240123\n\n### Miscellaneous lab stuff\n\n- Helped answer some questions Eric had regarding RNA isolation.\n\n### [CEABIGR](https://github.com/sr320/ceabigr) (GitHub repo)\n\n- Worked extensively on [exon sum threshold](https://github.com/sr320/ceabigr/blob/6b4bf89801a50180993331a927830d820b42e5e3/code/65-exon-coverage.qmd#L437-L486).\n\n### [Coral E5](https://github.com/urol-e5/deep-dive) (GitHub repo)\n\n- Answered some questions Danielle Becker had regarding Zymo's RiboFree rRNA depletion and whether or not it works for marine organisms (does not work for marine molluscs...).\n\n## 20240122\n\n### [CEABIGR](https://github.com/sr320/ceabigr) (GitHub repo)\n\n- [Steven decided on exon coverage threshold of 100 reads](https://github.com/sr320/ceabigr/issues/88#issuecomment-1904556525) (GitHub Issue).\n\n- Fleshed out more of the exon coverage threshold code.\n\n### Miscellaneous lab stuff\n\n- Got [updated quote for Cod WGBS](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/1732#issuecomment-1904854424) (GitHub Issue).\n\n## 20240119\n\n- Science Hour\n\n- Helped walk Eric (virtually) through lab to get ready for RNA isolations.\n\n### [CEABIGR](https://github.com/sr320/ceabigr) (GitHub repo)\n\n- Continued work I started on setting exon coverage threshold.\n\n## 20240111\n\n- Started getting students Raven access for Steven's course in Chile.\n\n### [Coral E5](https://github.com/urol-e5/deep-dive) (GitHub repo)\n\n- Need to test out Azenta recommended trimming parameters.\n\n- Worked briefly on manuscript.\n\n## 2024010\n\n### Lab meeting\n\n### [CEABIGR](https://github.com/sr320/ceabigr) (GitHub repo)\n\n- Yaamini and I reviewed spurious transcription data and determined some next steps:\n\n  - Spurious transcription calcs associated with different levels of gene methylation.\n\n  - Determine the slope of the ln(fold-change exon expression) per gene.\n\n## 20240109\n\n- Power outage all day...\n\n## 20240108\n\nIn lab:\n\n- Sent [replacement liver samples for Cod RNA-seq project](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/1764) (GitHub Issue).\n\n- Helped Noah get mercuric chloride waste transferred to EH&S carboys in FTR 228.\n\n- Had to do a fresh install of R on `swoose`. Took awhile...\n\n## 20240105\n\n- Science Hour\n\n### [CEABIGR](https://github.com/sr320/ceabigr) (GitHub repo)\n\n- Started to look into where (if?) we have methylation data on a per gene basis to plot vs. exon fold-change data from [20240103](#)\n\n## 20240104\n\n- Disabled Sensaphone input #3 due to frequent calls. This is the sensor for the \"middle\" -80<sup>o</sup>C freezer. This is an older freezer from a former professor, so I'm not sure we have any info on how to set it up, but I will see if I can figure out how to change the freezer temp limits, instead of disabling the Sensaphone.\n\n- Investigated [a budget spending discrepancy issue]() (GitHub Issue).\n\n- Added a [page about RStudio Server access on Raven](https://github.com/RobertsLab/tusk/blob/main/modules/05-computers.qmd) on the [tusk](https://robertslab.github.io/tusk/) website, per [this GitHub Issue.](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/1776)\n\n## 20240103\n\n### [CEABIGR](https://github.com/sr320/ceabigr) (GitHub repo)\n\n - Worked extensively on [calculating mean, natural log fold change of Exons 2 - 6, relative to Exon 1 expression across all genes, in all samples](https://github.com/sr320/ceabigr/blob/main/code/65-exon-coverage.qmd).\n\n - Generated line plots of the various possible comparisons.\n\n## 20240102\n",
