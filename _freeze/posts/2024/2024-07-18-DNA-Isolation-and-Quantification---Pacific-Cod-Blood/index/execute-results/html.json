Laura Spencer [identified a set of samples](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/1922#issuecomment-2189879056) (GitHub Issue). Below is the list of samples I isolated DNA from:\n\n- `4B`\n- `11B`\n- `30B`\n- `39`\n- `47`\n- `70`\n\n::: {.callout-important}\nThe following blood samples were _not_ located in the freezer boxes:\n\n- `12B`\n- `18B`\n- `50B`\n- `59B`\n\n:::\n\n# METHODS\n\n## DNA Isolations\n\nDNA was isolated using the Quick-DNA Miniprep Kit (ZymoResearch), according to the manufacturer's protocol - including the recommended addition of beta-mercaptoethanol to the buffer. Pacific cod blood had been collected and frozen/stored at -80<sup>o</sup>C, with no preservatives/anticoagulants (e.g. heparin). Blood was thawed on ice and briefly centrifuged (20s @ 10,000g) to collect blood at bottom of tubes. Since the volumes of all blood samples was < 50uL, I added 200uL of g-DNA Lysis Buffer to each tube (per the manufacturer's protocol for blood isolations). DNA was eventually eluted with 50uL of Elution Buffer.\n\n## DNA Quantification\n\nSubsequently, DNA was quantified using the 1x dsDNA Broad Range Qubit Assay (ThermoFisher). One microliter of sample was combined with 199uL of the dye/buffer mix and measured on a Qubit 3.0.\n\n\nDNA was stored in the same boxes and positions in which the blood had been stored in the -80<sup>o</sup>C freezer.\n\n\n# RESULTS\n\n## Qubit data\n\n- [20240718-gmac-qubit-DNA.br-blood.csv](./20240718-gmac-qubit-DNA.br-blood.csv)\n\n| sample_ID | Original sample conc.(ng/uL) |\n|-----------|------------------------------|\n| 4B        | 9.36                         |\n| 11B       | 212                          |\n| 30B       | 1100                         |\n| 39B       | 506                          |\n| 47B       | 3.3                          |\n| 70B       | 830                          |\n",
