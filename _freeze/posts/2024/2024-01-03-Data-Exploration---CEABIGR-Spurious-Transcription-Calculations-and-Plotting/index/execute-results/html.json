The decision to perform the calculation in this manner was based on [@li2018]. I took the next steps to perform this across all samples, as well as generate some comparison plots. After this, will explore how spurious transcription relates to methylation levels across genes.\n\nSee [`65-exon-coverage.qmd`](https://github.com/sr320/ceabigr/blob/585fb039e7d7b12295781f0a0141e84eee901631/code/65-exon-coverage.qmd) for code.\n\n::: callout-note\nCode and plots link to commit `585fb03`.\n:::\n\n# Plots\n\nAll plots are line plots of the mean natural log fold-change in exon expression (Exons 2-6), relative to Exon 1.
