Liver tissues had been stored @ -20<sup>o</sup>C in RNALater (Ambion). I thawed the tubes, transferred the entire liver tissue (which was very small) to a disposable mortar/pestle combo (1.5mL tube) and homogenized. DNA was eventually eluted with 50uL of Elution Buffer.\n\nSubsequently, DNA was quantified using the 1x dsDNA Broad Range Qubit Assay (ThermoFisher). One microliter of sample was combined with 199uL of the dye/buffer mix and measured on a Qubit 3.0.\n\nDNA was stored in a box labelled \"Lake Trout Liver gDNA\" in the FTR 209 -20<sup>o</sup>C freezer.\n\n## Agarose gel\n\nApproximately 0.1uL of each sample was run an a 0.8% low-TAE agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide. This was done just to spot check samples and I wasn't concerned about loading exact quantities of DNA (or equal quantities) across samples. Sample volumes were mixed with 10uL of H<sub>2</sub>O and 2uL of [6x Orange DNA Loading Dye (Thermo Scientific)](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/R0631). \n\nThe gel was run @ 107V for ~45mins and then imaged.\n\n[O'GeneRuler DNA Ladder Mix, Ready-to-Use 100-10,00bp (Thermo Scientific)](https://www.fishersci.se/shop/products/fermentas-o-generuler-ready-to-use-dna-ladder-mix/11803983) was used (5uL) for size reference:\n\n![Ladder](../../../images/ogene-ruler.jpeg){#fig-ladder fig-alt=\"O'GeneRuler\" .lightbox}\n\n\n# RESULTS\n\n## Qubit data\n\n- [20241025-snam-qubit-DNA.br-liver](./20241025-snam-qubit-DNA.br-liver)\n\n\n| sample_ID | Original sample conc. (ng/uL) | yield(ng) |\n|-----------|-------------------------------|-----------|\n| FA046     | 224                           | 8960      |\n| FA047     | 984                           | 39360     |\n| FA048     | 1180                          | 47200     |\n| FA049     | 584                           | 23360     |\n| FA050     | 185                           | 7400      |\n| FA051     | 990                           | 39600     |\n| FA055     | 770                           | 30800     |\n| FA056     | 792                           | 31680     |\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nYield calculation is based on a total sample volume of 40uL. This is likely a conservative volume estimation for each sample, so the total yield is likely a bit higher for each.\n:::\n\n## Agarose Gel\n\nSamples were loaded in numerical order, left to right.\n\nSamples FA47 and FA48 have the most prominent bands, but faint bands are visible in all the other lanes (you may need to squint, LOL). Low visibility of bands is most likely due to the inaccuracy involved with attempting to pipette 0.1uL using a P10 pipette... All bands are high molecular weight and don't show any evidence of degradation (smearing).\n\n\n\n![Agarose gel showing high molecular weight bands for most samples.
