I [designed PCR primers for the C1Q gene on 20240916](../2024-09-16-Primer-Design---Lake-Trout-C1q-Gene-Sequencing-Primers-Using-Primer3/index.qmd). I opted to test these out on a pool of the [_Salvelinus namaycush_ gDNA isolated on 20240712](../2024-07-12-DNA-Isolation-and-Quantification---Lake-Trout-Liver/index.qmd).\n\nI also opted to test out some C1q gene primers I found in a box of Rick Goetz's. My guess is that these are for qPCR, but since I'm testing gDNA _and_ I don't know the full gene structure (without needing to take the time to look), I decided to just try these as well.\n\n\n\n## MATERIALS & METHODS\n\n### DNA Pooling\n\n1uL of each sample was used to create a pool of gDNA.\n\n### PCR Reactions\n\nPCR reactions were run using [EpiMark Hot Start Taq DNA Polymerase](https://www.neb.com/en-us/products/m0490-epimark-hot-start-taq-dna-polymerase) (New England Biolabs), according to the [manufacturer's protocol](https://www.neb.com/en-us/protocols/2012/09/25/epimark-hot-start-taq-dna-polymerase-guidelines-for-pcr-reactions-m0490), in a total reaction volume of 25uL.\n\nI ran each primer set in duplicate, using 0.5uL of the pooled liver gDNA for template. Each reaction was prepared _individually_ (i.e. no master mix was created).\n\nPrimers used:\n\n- `Sn-C1q-F/R` (SRIDs: 1842/3)\n- `C1Q F.1/2` (Rick Goetz primers)\n\n![Goetz C1q primers.](./20240924-snam-goetz-c1q-primers.jpg){#fig-goetz-C1q-primers fig-alt=\"Goetz C1q primers.\" .lightbox}\n\n\n### PCR Cycling\n\nAnnealing temperature gradient PCR was performed in a CFX Connect (BioRad) thermalcycler.\n\nCycling params:\n\n\n![Screenshot of cycling program, also sdhowing temperature gradient.](./20240924-snam-c1q-pcr.png){#fig-PCR-parameters fig-alt=\"PCR cycling parameters.\"}\n\n\n1. 95<sup>o</sup>C - 30s\n2. 95<sup>o</sup>C - 15s\n3. 55<sup>o</sup>C - 30s\n4. 68<sup>o</sup>C - 4m\n5. Go to Step 2 x 39.\n6. 68<sup>o</sup>C - 5m\n7. 4<sup>o</sup>C - FOREVER\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nExtension step was set to 4m due to the [expected amplicon size of C1q using the Roberts Lab primers](../2024-09-16-Primer-Design---Lake-Trout-C1q-Gene-Sequencing-Primers-Using-Primer3/index.qmd) (Notebook) of 3192bp. Most DNA polymerases (including [EpiMark Hot Start Taq DNA Polymerase](https://www.neb.com/en-us/products/m0490-epimark-hot-start-taq-dna-polymerase)) process 1Kbp/min, so setting to four mins is a tad long, but will certainly ensure the full gene length is amplified.\n:::\n\nPCR reactions were loaded on a low-TAE, 1.0% agarose gel, with ethidium bromide. Gel was run at 107V for ~45mins and then imaged.\n\nO'GeneRuler (ThermoFisher) Ladder was used (5uL) for size reference:\n\n![Ladder](../../../images/ogene-ruler.jpeg){#fig-ladder fig-alt=\"O'GeneRuler\" .lightbox}\n\n## RESULTS\n\nFor the `Sn-C1q-F/R` (SRIDs: 1842/3) primers, we see a prominent amplicon at the expect size of ~3100bp.\n\nWith the `C1Q F.1/2` (Rick Goetz primers), the most prominent band is ~1300bp. There's nothing terribly informative about this, as these were just used a secondary means to confirm that the PCRs were working/failing.\n\nSurprisingly, we also see a great deal of non-specific amplification. Although this is likely related to the annealing temp (55<sup>o</sup>C), it's still surprising considering that [I checked primer specificity using EMBOSS PrimeSearch](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/posts/2024/2024-09-16-Primer-Design---Lake-Trout-C1q-Gene-Sequencing-Primers-Using-Primer3/#check-primer-matches) (Notebook) and the primers each only had a single match in the genome...\n\n\n![Gel image showing Roberts Lab C1q primers on left, Goetz primers on right. Roberts Lab primers exhibit a prominent band at the expected size of ~3100bp. The Goetz primers exhibit a prominent band of ~1300bp.](./20240924-snam-c1q-pcr-gel.jpg){#fig-gel-image fig-alt=\"Gel image showing Roberts Lab C1q primers on left, Goetz primers on right.

The Goetz primers exhibit a prominent band of ~1300bp.\" .lightbox}\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nThese PCRs confirmed that the source DNA is good and primers designed using our methodology appears to work. To continue trying to address what's wrong with [the bisulfite primers/PCRs](../2024-09-11-Bisulfite-PCR---Second-Primer-Annealing-Gradient-Test-with-Lake-Trout-Bisulfite-treated-DNA/index.qmd) (Notebook), I'll attempt to quantify the [bisulfite-converted DNA](../2024-08-13-Bisulfite-Conversion---Lake-Trout-gDNA-Using-EZ-DNA-Methylation-Lightning-Kit/index.qmd) (Notebook), which I did not do at the time. I'll also run a PCR using the same primers used here (i.e. regular primers, not bisulfite primers) on the bisulfite-converted DNA, just to see what happens.\n",
