All files were downloaded and [MD5 checksums were verified](#checksum-verification). Raw FastQ files are available here:\n\n- https://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/E5-coral-time-series/30-1067895835/\n\nAzenta report (HTML):\n\n- [https://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/E5-coral-time-series/30-1067895835/Azenta_30-1067895835_Data_Report.html](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/E5-coral-time-series/30-1067895835/Azenta_30-1067895835_Data_Report.html)\n\n::: {.callout-important}\nRead counts range from 25M - 58M. Normally, a large range like this would be concerning, however, we advised Azenta to go forward with \"best effort\", due to some samples failing their initial QC.\n:::\n\n# CHECKSUM VERIFICATION\n\n![Screenshot of MD5 checksum verifications. ](./20241230-E5-timeseries-WGBS-checksums-01.png){#fig-MD5-01 fig-alt=\"Screenshot of MD5 checksum verifications.\" .lightbox}\n\n![Screenshot of MD5 checksum verifications. ](./20241230-E5-timeseries-WGBS-checksums-02.png){#fig-MD5-02 fig-alt=\"Screenshot of MD5 checksum verifications.\" .lightbox}\n\n![Screenshot of MD5 checksum verifications. ](./20241230-E5-timeseries-WGBS-checksums-03.png){#fig-MD5-03 fig-alt=\"Screenshot of MD5 checksum verifications.\" .lightbox}\n\n![Screenshot of MD5 checksum verifications. ](./20241230-E5-timeseries-WGBS-checksums-04.png){#fig-MD5-04 fig-alt=\"Screenshot of MD5 checksum verifications.\" .lightbox}\n\n![Screenshot of MD5 checksum verifications. ](./20241230-E5-timeseries-WGBS-checksums-05.png){#fig-MD5-05 fig-alt=\"Screenshot of MD5 checksum verifications.\" .lightbox}\n\n![Screenshot of MD5 checksum verifications. ](./20241230-E5-timeseries-WGBS-checksums-06.png){#fig-MD5-06 fig-alt=\"Screenshot of MD5 checksum verifications.\" .lightbox}",
