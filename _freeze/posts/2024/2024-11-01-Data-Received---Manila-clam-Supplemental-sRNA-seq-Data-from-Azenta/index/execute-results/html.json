Azenta agreed to perform additional sequencing to reach that threshold.\n\nData was downloaded to:\n\nhttps://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/R_philippinarum/30-1035633055-TS01/\n\nMD5 checksums were verified:\n\n![Screenshot showing successful MD5 checksum verifications.](./20241101-rphi-md5-checksums-screenshot.png){#fig-ladder fig-alt=\"Screenshot showing successful MD5 checksum verifications.\" .lightbox}\n\n\nSince it appears that there is sequencing data for _all_ samples, it probably make sense to concatenate this supplemental data to the initial run, but I'll check with Steven before doing so.\n",
