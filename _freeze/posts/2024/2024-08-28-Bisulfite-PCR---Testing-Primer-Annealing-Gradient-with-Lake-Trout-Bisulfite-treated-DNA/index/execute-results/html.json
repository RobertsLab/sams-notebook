The [cycling program](#pcr-cycling) was setup incorrectly. Notebook post is being left for posterity.\n:::\n\nWell, nothing like starting off a notebook post with a callout indicating this was done incorrectly... I'll leave all of this here anyway.\n\nAfter previously [designing bisulfite PCR primers for the C1Q gene on 20240709](../2024-07-29-Primer-Design---Lake-Trout-C1q-Gene-Bisulfite-Sequencing-Primers-Using-Primer3/index.qmd), it was time to actually test them out. Due to their length, low complexity, and low melting temperatures (T<sub>m</sub>) I opted to test these out on a pool of the [_Salvelinus namaycush_ gDNA isolated on 20240712](../2024-07-12-DNA-Isolation-and-Quantification---Lake-Trout-Liver/index.qmd), using a temperature gradient.\n\n## MATERIALS & METHODS\n\n### DNA Pooling\n\n1uL of each sample was used to create a pool of gDNA.\n\n### PCR Reactions\n\nPCR reactions were run using [EpiMark Hot Start Taq DNA Polymerase](https://www.neb.com/en-us/products/m0490-epimark-hot-start-taq-dna-polymerase) (New England Biolabs), according to the [manufacturer's protocol](https://www.neb.com/en-us/protocols/2012/09/25/epimark-hot-start-taq-dna-polymerase-guidelines-for-pcr-reactions-m0490), in a total reaction volume of 25uL, using 1uL of the pooled gDNA.\n\nSince I was testing three different annealing temps (45<sup>o</sup>C, 50<sup>o</sup>C, and 55<sup>o</sup>C), I ran reactions in duplicate for each temperature (i.e. a total of six reactions).\n\n### PCR Cycling\n\nAnnealing temperature gradient PCR was performed in a CFX Connect (BioRad).\n\nCycling params:\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\nThe cycling program is incorrect and never actually goes through cycling!!!\n:::\n\n![Screenshot of cycling program, also sdhowing temperature gradient.](./20240828-snam-bs-pcr-gradient-range.png){#fig-PCR-parameters fig-alt=\"PCR cycling parameters.\"}\n\n\n1. 95<sup>o</sup>C - 30s\n2. 95<sup>o</sup>C - 15s\n3. 45 - 55<sup>o</sup>C - 20s\n4. 68<sup>o</sup>C - 4m\n5. 68<sup>o</sup>C - 5m\n6. 4<sup>o</sup>C - FOREVER\n7. Go to Step 2.\n\nSamples were loaded in the following positions:\n\n![PCR tube placement in thermacylcer](./20240828-snam-bs-pcr-tube-placement.jpg){#fig-tubes fig-alt=\"Tube placement in thermalcylcer.\"}\n\nPCR reactions were loaded on a low-TAE, 1.0% agarose gel, with ethidium bromide. Gel was run at 107V for ~45mins and then imaged.\n\nO'GeneRuler (ThermoFisher) Ladder was used (5uL) for size reference:\n\n![Ladder](../2024-05-31-Agarose-Gel---G.macrocephalus-gDNA-from-20240521/ogene-ruler.jpeg){#fig-ladder fig-alt=\"O'GeneRuler\" .lightbox}\n\n## RESULTS\n\nNo amplification.\n\n\n![Agarose gel with pairs of lanes marked with PCR annealing temperatures of 45<sup>o</sup>C, 50<sup>o</sup>C, and 55<sup>o</sup>C](./20240828-snam-bs-pcr-gel.jpg){#fig-gel fig-alt=\"Agarose gel with labels of of 45<sup>o</sup>C, 50<sup>o</sup>C, and 55<sup>o</sup>C, indicating annealing temperatures\"}\n",
