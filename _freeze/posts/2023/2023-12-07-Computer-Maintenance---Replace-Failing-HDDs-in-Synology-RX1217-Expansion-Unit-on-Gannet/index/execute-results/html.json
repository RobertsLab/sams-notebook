Considering this unit, and the corresponding HDDs, were installed in July, this is highly disappointing. Plus, these are 18TB HDDs and are not cheap to replace.\n\n![Three drive failures](20231207-syno-logs-HDD-failures.png){#fig-synology_table fig-alt=\"Synology logs showing three drives failing S.M.A.R.T. tests\"}\n\n\nOrdered three replacement drives (Seagate Iron Wolf Pro; 16TB) and they finally arrived. I swapped two of the drives, following the Synology Storage Manager wizard, but had to wait for the drives to go through various checks before I could install the third (will do this this weekend).\n\nHowever, when trying to investigate the drive failures using Seagate's SeaTools, both drives passed the \"generic short test\". However, neither drive could complete the \"generic long test.\" No errors were generated, just that the \"generic long test\" failed. When I registered the drives with Seagate, Seagate indicated that the drives' warranties ended on 11/27/2023! These were brand new drives purchased in July 2023! The warranty should be significantly longer than 5 months.\n\n![Three HDDs registered with Seagate showing they're out of warranty as of 20231127](20231207-seagate-hdd-registration-expired.png)\n\nAlthough, I did find some info suggesting that these failing drives are possibly linked to a Synology database error which is sometimes related to power outages (which just so happens to be when we started getting these errors...) here:\n\nhttps://www.synoforum.com/threads/reset-drive-critical-state.8787/\n\nI'm not going to pursue that route because these drives should still be under warranty.\n\nWill reach out to the vendor via Amazon to see what can be done about this...\n",
