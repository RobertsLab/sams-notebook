Made a couple of suggestsions for her to work on:\n\n  - Develop/teach Apptainers (Singularity).\n\n  - Develop BLAST/UniProt/GO annotation pipeline.\n\n## 20231117\n\n[Coral E5](https://github.com/urol-e5/deep-dive) (GitHub repo)\n\n- Finished adding numbers to presentation.\n\n- E5 molecular meeting\n\n  - Decided to re-evaluate trimming, due to lack of matches in R2 reads.\n\n## 20231116\n\n- [Coral E5](https://github.com/urol-e5/deep-dive) (GitHub repo):\n\n  - Continued _P.evermanni_ sRNAseq analysis.\n\n  - Work on presentation for tomorrow.\n\n- [CEABIGR](https://github.com/sr320/ceabigr) (GitHub repo)\n\n  - Discussed spurious transcription:\n\n    - [Decided to calculate exon expression regression](https://github.com/sr320/ceabigr/issues/86) (GitHub Issue)\n\n- Helped Grace L. with a git/GitHub issue on Raven (committed files which were too big for GitHub).\n\n## 20231115\n\n- [Coral E5](https://github.com/urol-e5/deep-dive) (GitHub repo):\n\n  - Started _P.evermanni_ sRNAseq analysis.\n\n## 20231114\n\n-[Coral E5](https://github.com/urol-e5/deep-dive) (GitHub repo):\n\n  - Knitted [`miRDeep2`](https://github.com/rajewsky-lab/mirdeep2) analysis to markdown and HTML.\n\n## 20231113\n\n-[Coral E5](https://github.com/urol-e5/deep-dive) (GitHub repo):\n\n  - [`miRDeep2`](https://github.com/rajewsky-lab/mirdeep2) analysis finally completed after 72hrs (!).\n\n  - Started teasing out some of the results from the MiRDeep2 analysis.\n\n## 20231109\n\n- [DuMOAR](https://github.com/laurahspencer/DuMOAR)\n\n  - Ran [DIAMOND BLASTx](https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond) to use for [Trinotate](https://github.com/Trinotate/Trinotate/wiki).\n\n  - Ran [Trinotate](https://github.com/Trinotate/Trinotate/wiki).\n\n## 20231108\n\n- Coral E5\n\n  - Dealt with the trials and tribulations of getting [miRDeep2](https://github.com/rajewsky-lab/mirdeep2) to run. There are a lot of \"hidden\" file formatting requirements which aren't documented until a job fails. Even then, the error messages don't provide any advice. However, finally got it running!\n\n- Read Ch. 1 of \"Race After Technology: The New Jim Code\" by Ruha Benjamin for DEI bookclub discussion at tomorrow's lab meeting.\n\n## 20231107\n\n- Coral E5\n\n  - Ran NCBI BLASTn on _A.pulcha_ sRNAseq.\n\n- [DuMOAR](https://github.com/laurahspencer/DuMOAR)\n\n  - Began [transcriptome annotation](https://github.com/laurahspencer/DuMOAR/issues/44) (GitHub) issue with [TransDecoder](https://github.com/TransDecoder/TransDecoder/wiki).\n\n## 20231106\n\n- ProCard reconciliation.\n\n- Scan/upload packing slips for purchases to Workday.\n\n- Coral E5\n\n  - non-coding RNA meeting.\n\n  - Begin miRNA BLASTn.\n\n## 20231103\n\n- Coral E5\n\n  - Ran [ShortStack](https://github.com/MikeAxtell/ShortStack) on _A.pulchra_ (uses _A.millepora_ genome though, since no _A.pulchra_ genome exists) sRNAseq reads to identify potential miRNAs.\n\n    - [13-Apul-sRNAseq-ShortStack.Rmd](https://github.com/urol-e5/deep-dive/blob/main/D-Apul/code/13-Apul-sRNAseq-ShortStack.Rmd)\n\n    - Wasted a _lot_ time messing around/learning how to Knit documements in R Markdown.\n\n## 20231102\n\n- In lab.\n\n- E5 lncRNA meeting.\n\n- Lab meeting.\n\n- CEABIGR meeting.\n\n- Coral E5\n\n  - Ran [MirMachine](https://github.com/sinanugur/MirMachine) to identify miRNAs in _A.pulchra_.\n\n    - [12-Apul-sRNAseq-MirMachine.Rmd](https://github.com/urol-e5/deep-dive/blob/main/D-Apul/code/12-Apul-sRNAseq-MirMachine.Rmd)\n\n\n\n## 20231101\n\n- Read intro to \"Race After Technology: Abolisitionist for the new Jim Code\".\n\n- Coral E5\n\n  - Ran [miRTrace](https://github.com/friedlanderlab/mirtrace) on _A.pulcrha_ sRNAseq data to identify potential taxonomic origins of miRNAs.\n\n    - [09-Apul-sRNAseq-miRTrace.Rmd](https://github.com/urol-e5/deep-dive/blob/main/D-Apul/code/09-Apul-sRNAseq-miRTrace.Rmd)\n",
