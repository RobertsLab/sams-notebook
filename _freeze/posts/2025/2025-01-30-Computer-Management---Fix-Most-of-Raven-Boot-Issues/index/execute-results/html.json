Doesn't reboot automatically after a power outage.\n\n2. Dell Pre-boot System Performance fan failure message, which prevented the system from booting without manual intervention.\n\n3. Booting into `emergency mode`.\n\n4. Screen doesn't boot into Ubuntu desktop. Instead boot is successful, but just shows a log of boot loading steps on the screen.\n\n# FIXES \n\nPerformed the following changes to Raven in order to resolve most of the booting issues we've experienced:\n\n- Installed new monitor (not related to booting, obviously, but we didn't have a monitor for Raven which made troubleshooting some of the following items impossible).\n\n\n\n1. In BIOS, enabled automatic reboot after power outage. Pretty sure this used to be enabled. Maybe a firmware update reset it?\n\n2. In BIOS, unchecked all of the boxes for HDD fan checks. The fans will be checked regardless, _if_ the system detects that a HDD fan is installed. This will eliminate the Dell Pre-boot System Performance fan failure message, which prevented the system from booting without manual intervention. The previous fan error due to the system checking for a fan which _was not installed_.\n\n3. Fixed `/etc/fstab` and commented out a HDD which is no longer installed in the system. This was causing the system to boot into emergency mode due to the system looking for, and not finding, said HDD.\n\n4.\n\n- 4a. Switched desktop manager from `gdm3` to `lightdm` in attempt to get the system to boot to the Ubuntu desktop. This did not work.\n\n- 4b. Edited the grub configuration file (`/etc/default/grub`) to avoid indefinite hang on Ubuntu splash screen:\n\nChanged: `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"`\n\nTo: `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"\"`\n\n# RESULTS\n\nWith all of the above changes, Raven now boots successfully, without human intervention directly into a console screen. Although I couldn't figure out how to get this to boot into the desktop, that's really of very little consequence as this is used a \"headless\" system 99% of the time.\n\n",
