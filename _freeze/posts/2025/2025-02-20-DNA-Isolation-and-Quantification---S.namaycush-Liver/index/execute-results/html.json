As part of this project, DNA is being subjected to long read sequencing. A subset of the samples previously sent did not perform well, so need to be replaced.\n\n# MATERIALS & METHODS\n\n## DNA Isolations\n\nDNA was isolated from five Lean and five Siscowet ecotypes using the Quick-DNA Microprep Kit (ZymoResearch; Cat: D3024), according to the manufacturer's protocol, with the inclusion of beta-mercaptoethanol in the DNA Lysis Buffer.\n\nBriefly, the liver tissue had been stored @ -20<sup>o</sup>C in RNAlater. Samples were thawed and the entirety of the sample was transferred to a 1.5mL snap cap tubed. Samples were homogenized using disposable plastic pestles (Fisher Scientific; Cat; K749520-0090). Insolbule debris was pelleted and supernatant was transferred to spin columns. Samples were processed per the manufacturer's protocol.\n\nDNA was eluted with 50uL of Elution Buffer.\n\nDNA was stored @ -20<sup>o</sup>C in my \"Lake Trout Liver gDNA\" box in FTR 209.\n\n## DNA Quantification\n\nDNA was quantified using the Qubit 1x dsDNA HS Assay (Invitrogen; Q33231) on the Roberts Lab Qubit 3.0 fluorometer. 1uL of each sample was used.\n\n\n# RESULTS\n\nQubit data (Google Sheet):\n\n- [20250220-snam-qubit-DNA.hs-liver](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QTeE37cF-0oe1bgWQrgKs_ebgQi1LCFjtOq5WeUCS4I/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n| Sample | Ecoytpe | Concentration(ng/uL) | Volume(uL) | Total(ng) |\n|--------|---------|----------------------|------------|-----------|\n| FA091  | Lean    | 146                  | 40         | 5840      |\n| FA092  | Lean    | 540                  | 40         | 21600     |\n| FA093  | Lean    | 36.8                 | 25         | 920       |\n| FA094  | Lean    | 214                  | 40         | 8560      |\n| FA095  | Lean    | 253                  | 40         | 10120     |\n| FA096  | Sisco   | 38.8                 | 40         | 1552      |\n| FA097  | Sisco   | 258                  | 40         | 10320     |\n| FA098  | Sisco   | 22.5                 | 40         | 900       |\n| FA099  | Sisco   | 238                  | 40         | 9520      |\n| FA100  | Sisco   | 205                  | 40         | 8200      |\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nSample FA093 experienced clogging in the column, resulting in low yield.\n:::",
