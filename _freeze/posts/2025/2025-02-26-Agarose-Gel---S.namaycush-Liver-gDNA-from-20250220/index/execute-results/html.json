I prepared the DNA for loading by combining each sample with 1uL of [6x Orange DNA Loading Dye (Thermo Scientific)](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/R0631) and water to a final volume of 6uL. The gel was run @ 107V for ~45mins and then imaged.\n\n[O'GeneRuler DNA Ladder Mix, Ready-to-Use 100-10,00bp (Thermo Scientific)](https://www.fishersci.se/shop/products/fermentas-o-generuler-ready-to-use-dna-ladder-mix/11803983) was used (5uL) for size reference:\n\n![Ladder](../../../images/ogene-ruler.jpeg){#fig-ladder fig-alt=\"O'GeneRuler\" .lightbox}\n\n# RESULTS\n\n\n![Agarose gel showing red circles with white numbers, representing sample IDs. Unlabeled lanes are the DNA ladder. Sample 92 shows smearing, indicating degredation. Sample 93 shows no DNA.](./20250226-snam-gel-liver-gDNA.png){#fig-gel fig-alt=\"Agarose gel showing red circles with white numbers, representing sample IDs. Unlabeled lanes are the DNA ladder. Sample 92 shows smearing, indicating degredation. Sample 93 shows no DNA.\" .lightbox}\n\n# DISCUSSION\n\nMost samples have a faint, but visible high molecular weight band indicating high quality, intact gDNA. Sample 92 shows smearing, indicating degradation. Sample 93 shows no DNA. Will pass info along to Steven to determine if samples can be submitted for sequencing, as indicated in [the DNA isolation notebook from 20250220](../2025-02-20-DNA-Isolation-and-Quantification---S.namaycush-Liver/index.qmd) (Notebook entry).",
