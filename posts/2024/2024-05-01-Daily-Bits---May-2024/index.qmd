### [Coral E5](https://github.com/urol-e5/deep-dive) (GitHub repo)

- Developer came through with a fix for the ShortStack [`index error out of range` issue](https://github.com/MikeAxtell/ShortStack/issues/146#issuecomment-2093495262) (GitHub Issue)!!

- Started to run [`ShortStack`](https://github.com/MikeAxtell/ShortStack) on _P.evermanni_.

### Pub-a-thon

- Need to write up the _P.evermanni_ [`ShortStack`](https://github.com/MikeAxtell/ShortStack) results (finally!).

### Lab meeting

- Spent the time discussing gene enrichment.

### [Coral E5](https://github.com/urol-e5/deep-dive) (GitHub repo)

- Continued to try to troubleshoot the [`index error out of range` issue](https://github.com/MikeAxtell/ShortStack/issues/146#issuecomment-2093495262) (GitHub Issue) for _P.evermanni_.

  - Developer responded! Tested out some things.

  - Met with Steven to try to run on different computer.

### [Coral E5](https://github.com/urol-e5/deep-dive) (GitHub repo)

- Continued to try to troubleshoot the [`index error out of range` issue](https://github.com/MikeAxtell/ShortStack/issues/146#issuecomment-2093495262) (GitHub Issue) for _P.evermanni_.

  - No real progress. I've added various print statements to the source code to try to figure out where things are going wrong, but it's not very informative.

  - Tried a different set of trimming parameters (30bp instead of 30) to see if that might make a difference, but it didn't...

### Science Hour

- Discussed gene enrichment analysis with Grace L. and Laura Spencer.

  - Laura provided a nice, concise walk-through of using the [DAVID website](https://david.ncifcrf.gov/tools.jsp).

### Lab meeting

- Covered a lot of lab stuff for summer: undergrads, hack week, how-tos

- Discussed sections of "Braiding Sweetgrass"

### [Coral E5](https://github.com/urol-e5/deep-dive) (GitHub repo)

- Started to troubleshoot [`ShortStack`](https://github.com/MikeAxtell/ShortStack) `index error out of range` issue with _P.evermanni_.

### Pub-a-thon

- This actually evolved into discussion of differences between genome-guided alignments and alignment-free approaches.

## 20240501

### Miscellaneous

- Updated Gannet's list of notebook backups.

- Read sections of "Braiding Sweetgrass" for lab meeting tomorrow.
