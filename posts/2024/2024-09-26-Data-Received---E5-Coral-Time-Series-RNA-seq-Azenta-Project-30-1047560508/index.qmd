# INTRO

Coral time series RNA-seq data for Azenta project 30-1047560508 became availalbe today. Data was downloaded to [nigthingales on Owl](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/E5-coral-time-series/30-1047560508/) and [MD5 checksums were verified](#md5-checksum-verification).

Sequencing report is here:

Additionally, the email I received with the data indicated some samples needed further QC evaluation, but didn't specify which samples:


I'll update this post when that data is received.
