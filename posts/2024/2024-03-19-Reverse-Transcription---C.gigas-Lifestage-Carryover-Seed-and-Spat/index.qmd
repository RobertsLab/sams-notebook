# INTRO
After isolating RNA [earlier today](../2024-03-19-RNA-Isolation---C.gigas-Lifestage-Carryover-Seed-and-Spat/index.qmd) (Notebook) for the [`project-gigas-carryover/lifestage_carryover`](../../../../project-gigas-carryover/lifestage_carryover/) (GitHub repo), I proceeded with reverse transcription for those samples with sufficient yields of RNA.

# MATERIALS & METHODS
Reverse transcription was run using 100ng of each sample, using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega) and oligo dT primers (Promega), according to the [manufacturer's protocol](../../../../resources/protocols/Commercial_Protocols/Promega_MMLV_RT.pdf) (PDF). Oligo dT primers and M-MLV reverse transcriptase amounts were adjusted to maintain the proper ratio, relative to the amount of input RNA.

# RESULTS

cDNA was stored in the -20<sup>o</sup>C freezer in FTR 213.
