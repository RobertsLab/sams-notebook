# INTRO

We received whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data from Azenta project 30-1067895835. All files were downloaded and [MD5 checksums were verified](#checksum-verification). Raw FastQ files are available here:

- https://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/G_macrocephalus/30-1067895835/

Azenta report (HTML):

- [https://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/G_macrocephalus/30-1067895835/Azenta_30-1067895835_Data_Report.html](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/G_macrocephalus/30-1067895835/Azenta_30-1067895835_Data_Report.html)

Sequencing yielded ~47.5M reads for sample 1D11.

::: {.callout-note}
Sample 1D11 was sequenced as an add-on to the sample plate of a different, larger project ([Coral E5 time series](https://github.com/urol-e5/timeseries_molecular) (GitHub Repo)). As such, the Azenta report contains sequencing information for a large number of unrelated samples.
