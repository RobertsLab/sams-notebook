| SR ID | Primer Name          |

| 1829  | Cg_VIPERIN_F         |

All samples were run in triplicate, on low-profile, white 96-well plates (USA Scientific) in a CFX Connect (Bio-Rad) or CFX96 (Bio-Rad) real-time thermalcycler. All reactions consisted of the following:

| Component                                          | Stock Concentration | Volume (uL) |
|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| cDNA                                               | NA                  | 1           |
| SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR Green Supermix (BioRad) | 2x                  | 10          |
| P<sub>F</sub>                                      | 10uM                | 0.5         |
| P<sub>R</sub>                                      | 10uM                | 0.5         |
| H<sub>2</sub>O                                     | NA                  | 8           |
| TOTAL                                              |                     | 20          |

Master mixes were distributed across 2.5 plates for each primer set. No template controls (NTC) were loaded on on just one of the three plates (plate #3 in all instances).

For cycling parameters, plate layouts, etc. see the [RESULTS](#results) section below.


# RESULTS


## Summary

- `VIPERIN`: Amplification and melt plots look good. No amplification in NTCs.
