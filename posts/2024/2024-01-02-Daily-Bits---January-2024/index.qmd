## 20240105

- Science Hour

### [CEABIGR](https://github.com/sr320/ceabigr) (GitHub repo)

- Started to look into where (if?) we have methylation data on a per gene basis to plot vs. exon fold-change data from [20240103](#)

## 20240104

- Disabled Sensaphone input #3 due to frequent calls. This is the sensor for the "middle" -80<sup>o</sup>C freezer. This is an older freezer from a former professor, so I'm not sure we have any info on how to set it up, but I will see if I can figure out how to change the freezer temp limits, instead of disabling the Sensaphone.

- Investigated [a budget spending discrepancy issue]() (GitHub Issue).

- Added a [page about RStudio Server access on Raven](https://github.com/RobertsLab/tusk/blob/main/modules/05-computers.qmd) on the [tusk](https://robertslab.github.io/tusk/) website, per [this GitHub Issue.](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/1776)

## 20240103

### [CEABIGR](https://github.com/sr320/ceabigr) (GitHub repo)

 - Worked extensively on [calculating mean, natural log fold change of Exons 2 - 6, relative to Exon 1 expression across all genes, in all samples](https://github.com/sr320/ceabigr/blob/main/code/65-exon-coverage.qmd).

 - Generated line plots of the various possible comparisons.
