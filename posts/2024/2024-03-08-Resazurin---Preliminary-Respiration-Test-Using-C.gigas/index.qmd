# INTRO

We're beginning to gather some preliminary data for a project examining the effects of "stress priming" on \_[*Crassostrea gigas* (Pacific oyster)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_oyster). GitHub repo is [here](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-carryover). As part of that, Steven recently found out about a protocol to easily evaluate respiration in oysters using [resazurin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resazurin) (Wikipedia). According to [@gonzález-pinzón2012], the reduction of resazurin to resorufin is almost perfectly correlated with respiration in aerobic bacteria and, thus, can be used as a proxy to measure respiration. Offhand, I have not looked at literature detailing its use with eukaryotic cells - I just glanced at the literature cited by Wikipedia. :)

Ideally, using this method would provide a quick, cheap, and wasy way for us and hatcheries to monitor respiration in live oysters, with the potential to use the method as a means to detect stress-inducing events.

For this initial test, I followed the [resazurin assay](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-carryover/blob/27441a713dfe68578758103bb82dd4dca4b4c091/protocols/Resazurin-assay.md) (commit 27441a7) shared by Steven, with the following modifications:

- Non-sterile water/sea water was used.

- No penn/strep/Fungizone used.

Small oysters were distributed by Steven in two, 12-well (3x4) plates, and covered completely with 2mL of resazurin Assay Media:

- unstressed

  - Oysters were in all 12 wells.

- heat stressed (not sure what the temp or duration was)

  - Well C4 (bottom right) contained no oysters.

Two larger oyster which would not fit in the 12-well plates were each placed in a glass Petri dish and covered with 20mL of resazurin Assay Media.

Fluorescence was mesasured on a Victor 1420 (Perkin Elmer) plate reader. Plates were read directly, with the oysters in them. For the Petri dishes, 2mL were transferred from each into wells of a new 12-well plate and measured.
