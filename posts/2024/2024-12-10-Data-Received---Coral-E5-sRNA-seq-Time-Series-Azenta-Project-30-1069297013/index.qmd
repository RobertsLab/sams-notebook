# INTRO

We received sRNA-seq data from Azenta project 30-1069297013 as part of the [urol-e5/timeseries_molecular project](https://github.com/urol-e5/timeseries_molecular/tree/main) (GitHub repo). All files were downloaded and [MD5 checksums were verified](#checksum-verification). Raw FastQ files are available here:

::: {.callout-note}
From Azenta:
> Nine samples (1H2, 1G3, 1H3, 1C12, 1B6, 1H1, 1A11, 1F7, and 1F10) fell short of the quoted read counts. An attempt to re-sequence them was unsuccessful. Billing for the project will be adjusted appropriately.
:::

Interestingly, these nine samples are _not_ listed in the Azenta Report. I've reached out to Azenta to see what's going on.

Also, there were a number of files which had relatively low yields; <8M paired reads. These were samples which failed Azenta's initial QC and we told them to proceed with "best effort."

All samples listed below are from the _Porites sp._
