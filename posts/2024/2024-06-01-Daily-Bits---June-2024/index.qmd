## 20240603

### Hack-a-thon

- Helped Steven get SSH authorization for GitHub.

- Tried to sign up with `.edu` email address for free access to GitHub Copilot (not sure if this worked yet).

- Finished notebook for _G.macrocephalus_ [gDNA gel](../2024-05-31-Agarose-Gel---G.macrocephalus-gDNA-from-20240521/index.qmd).

- Dealt with annoying/weird notebook rendering issue.

- Began downloading NCBI `nr` BLAST database (literally took the entire day).
