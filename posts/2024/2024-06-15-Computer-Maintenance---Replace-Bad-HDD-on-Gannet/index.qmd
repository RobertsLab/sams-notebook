Hard drive recently failed (showed "Critical" status in Synology Storage Manager). Replaced the drive with a new one. Checking the serial number on Seagate's website indicates this drive is out of warranty, despite being purchased in July 2023. These should come with a 5yr warranty. I'll contact the seller and get this replaced.
