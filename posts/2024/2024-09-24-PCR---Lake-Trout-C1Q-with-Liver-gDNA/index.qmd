## INTRO

After a previous attempt at [amplifying the C1q gene in bisulfite-converted DNA failed](../2024-09-11-Bisulfite-PCR---Second-Primer-Annealing-Gradient-Test-with-Lake-Trout-Bisulfite-treated-DNA/index.qmd),  we decided we should test out a standard PCR on untreated liver gDNA. I [designed PCR primers for the C1Q gene on 20240916](../2024-09-16-Primer-Design---Lake-Trout-C1q-Gene-Sequencing-Primers-Using-Primer3/index.qmd). I opted to test these out on a pool of the [_Salvelinus namaycush_ gDNA isolated on 20240712](../2024-07-12-DNA-Isolation-and-Quantification---Lake-Trout-Liver/index.qmd).

I also opted to test out some C1q gene primers I found in a box of Rick Goetz's. My guess is that these are for qPCR, but since I'm testing gDNA _and_ I don't know the full gene structure (without needing to take the time to look), I decided to just try these as well.



## MATERIALS & METHODS

### DNA Pooling

1uL of each sample was used to create a pool of gDNA.

### PCR Reactions

PCR reactions were run using [EpiMark Hot Start Taq DNA Polymerase](https://www.neb.com/en-us/products/m0490-epimark-hot-start-taq-dna-polymerase) (New England Biolabs), according to the [manufacturer's protocol](https://www.neb.com/en-us/protocols/2012/09/25/epimark-hot-start-taq-dna-polymerase-guidelines-for-pcr-reactions-m0490), in a total reaction volume of 25uL.

I ran each primer set in duplicate, using 0.5uL of the pooled liver gDNA for template. Each reaction was prepared _individually_ (i.e. no master mix was created).


### PCR Cycling

Annealing temperature gradient PCR was performed in a CFX Connect (BioRad) thermalcycler.

Cycling params:


![Screenshot of cycling program, also sdhowing temperature gradient.](./20240924-snam-c1q-pcr.png){#fig-PCR-parameters fig-alt="PCR cycling parameters."}


1. 95<sup>o</sup>C - 30s
2. 95<sup>o</sup>C - 15s
3. 55<sup>o</sup>C - 30s
4. 68<sup>o</sup>C - 4m
5. Go to Step 2 x 39.
6. 68<sup>o</sup>C - 5m
7. 4<sup>o</sup>C - FOREVER

::: {.callout-tip}
Extension step was set to 4m due to the [expected amplicon size of C1q](../2024-09-16-Primer-Design---Lake-Trout-C1q-Gene-Sequencing-Primers-Using-Primer3/index.qmd) (Notebook) of 3192bp. Most DNA polymerases (including [EpiMark Hot Start Taq DNA Polymerase](https://www.neb.com/en-us/products/m0490-epimark-hot-start-taq-dna-polymerase)) process 1Kbp/min, so setting to four mins is a tad long, but will certainly ensure the full gene length is amplified.
:::

PCR reactions were loaded on a low-TAE, 1.0% agarose gel, with ethidium bromide. Gel was run at 107V for ~45mins and then imaged.

O'GeneRuler (ThermoFisher) Ladder was used (5uL) for size reference:
