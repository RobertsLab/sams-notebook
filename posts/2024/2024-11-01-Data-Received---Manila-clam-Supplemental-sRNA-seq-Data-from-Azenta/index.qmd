# INTRO

Received supplemental sRNA-seq data for Azenta Project 30-1035633055, since the [previous data sent](../2024-10-01-Data-Received---R.philippinarum-(Manilla-clam)-sRNA-seq-Data-from-Azenta-Project-30-1035633055/index.qmd) (Notebook) didn't amount to the minimum expected read count for a number of samples. Azenta agreed to perform additional sequencing to reach that threshold.

Data was downloaded to:

https://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/R_philippinarum/30-1035633055-TS01/

MD5 checksums were verified:

Since it appears that there is sequencing data for _all_ samples, it probably make sense to concatenate this supplemental data to the initial run, but I'll check with Steven before doing so.
