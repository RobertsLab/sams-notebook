### Coral E5

- [Downloaded updated RNA-seq data](../2024-09-26-Data-Received---E5-Coral-Time-Series-RNA-seq-Azenta-Project-30-1047560508/index.qmd), from Azenta, which was previously incomplete.

- Began work on script to [align _A.pulchra_ time series RNA-seq data](https://github.com/urol-e5/timeseries_molecular/issues/1) (GitHub Issue) in [`urol-e5/timeseries_molecular` repo](https://github.com/urol-e5/timeseries_molecular/tree/main)
