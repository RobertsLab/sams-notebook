Went to NOAA (NWFSC) to get Manilla clam (_Lajonkairia lajonkairii_) egg samples from Mac for an RNA-seq project.

Here's the [list of samples](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/1902#issuecomment-2148163401) (GitHub Issue):

Samples were stored in middle -80<sup>o</sup>C, due to the fact that the Roberts Lab -80<sup>o</sup>C is full:
