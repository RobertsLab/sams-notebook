# INTRO

I was [asked to isolate RNA from a list of samples](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/1844#issuecomment-1998021805) (GitHub Issue) from a number of [_Crassostrea gigas_ (Pacific oyster)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_oyster) spat and seed that had been collected as part of the [`project-gigas-carryover`](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-carryover/tree/main/lifestage_carryover) (GitHub repo).

# MATERIALS & METHODS
Oysters had been previously preserved in RNAlater (Ambion), supernatant removed, and then frozen @ -80<sup>o</sup>C. All samples were treated in the following fashion (12 spat were processed, followed by 12 seed samples.).

## RNA Isolation
RNA isolations were conducted using the Directzol RNA Miniprep Kit (ZymoResearch).

- Added 350uL of TriReagent (ZymoResearch) to existing 1.5mL tubes containing the sample.
- Homogenized using disposble pestles.
- Centrigured at 21,000g to pellet insoluble material.
- Transferred 325uL of homogenate to a 1.5mL tube.
- Added 325uL (i.e. equal volume) of 100% ethanol to homogenate and vortexed.
- Transferred solution to spin columns.
- Followed kit protocol, including DNase step.
- Elutions:

  - Spat: 50uL of H<sub>2</sub>.
  - Seed: 100uL of H<sub>2</sub>.

Samples were temporarily stored on ice for quantificaiton and reverse transcription.

## RNA Quantification
RNA was quantified with the Roberts Lab Qubit 3.0 fluorometer (Invitrogen). Samples were quantified with either the Qubit RNA Broad Range (BR) asssay (Invitrogen) or, if a sample had insufficient concentrations of RNA to be detected, with the High Sensitivity (HS) assay (Invitrogen). 1uL of sample was used for the assay(s).
