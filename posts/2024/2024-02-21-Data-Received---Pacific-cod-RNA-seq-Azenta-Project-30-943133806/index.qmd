# INTRO

Received Pacific cod liver/gill/spleen RNA-seq data back from Azenta today (project 30-943133806). Files were downloaded to Owl and [MD5 checksums were verified](#md5-checksum-verification). The [`Nightingales`](https://b.link/nightingales) (Google Sheet) spreadsheet has been updated with sample info.

Next steps are to run initial [`FastQC`](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/), as well as get them submitted to NCBI.
