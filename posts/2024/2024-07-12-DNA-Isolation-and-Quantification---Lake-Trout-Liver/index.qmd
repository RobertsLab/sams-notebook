# INTRO

Steven asked that I [isolate gDNA from a subset of lake trout (_S.namaycush_) liver samples](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/1929) (GitHub Issue) to use for targeted DNA methylation analyses -via qPCR.

# METHODS

DNA was isolated using the Quick-DNA Miniprep Kit (ZymoResearch), according to the manufacturer's protocol - including the recommended addition of beta-mercaptoethanol to the buffer. Live tissues had been stored @ -20<sup>o</sup>C in RNALater (Ambion). I thawed the tubes, transferred the entire liver tissue (which was very small) to a disposable mortar/pestle combo (1.5mL tube) and homogenized. DNA was eventually eluted with 50uL of Elution Buffer.

Subsequently, DNA was quantified using the 1x dsDNA Broad Range Qubit Assay (ThermoFisher). One microliter of sample was combined with 199uL of the dye/buffer mix and measured on a Qubit 3.0.
