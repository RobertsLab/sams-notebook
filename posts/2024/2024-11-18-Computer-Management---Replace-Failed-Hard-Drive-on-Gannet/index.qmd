Gannet was inaccessible, so went into lab to investigate. When I arrived, Gannet appeared to be powered on and the "Status" light was green, but none of the drive light indicators were on.

With no other recourse, I powered off Gannet and then powered it back on. All drive lights illuminated, with one of them red, indicating that drive had failed.

I was then able to access the Synology DSM web interface, removed the bad drive from the storage pool, physically replaced the bad drive, and added the new drive to the storage pool.

Everything looks good now, but it's not clear why Synology marked the drive as bad. Quick S.M.A.R.T. tests run on Synology and using Seagate's [SeaTools](https://www.seagate.com/support/downloads/seatools/) indicated the drive was fine...

I'll run an extended test using [SeaTools](https://www.seagate.com/support/downloads/seatools/) to see if that reports anything different.
