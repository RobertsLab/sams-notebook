# INTRO

We received whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data from Azenta project 30-1067895835 as part of the [urol-e5/timeseries_molecular project](https://github.com/urol-e5/timeseries_molecular/tree/main) (GitHub repo). All files were downloaded and [MD5 checksums were verified](#checksum-verification). Raw FastQ files are available here:

Read counts range from 25M - 58M. Normally, a large range like this would be concerning, however, we advised Azenta to go forward with "best effort", due to some samples failing their initial QC.
