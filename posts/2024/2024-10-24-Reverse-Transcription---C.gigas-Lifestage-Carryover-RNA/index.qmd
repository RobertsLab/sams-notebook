# INTRO
Continuing with [Ariana's request to extract RNA and run qPCRs](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/1891) (GitHub Issue) for the [`lifestage_carryover` project](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-carryover/tree/main/lifestage_carryover) (GitHub repo), I performed reverse transcription on RNA I previously isolated:

- [20240615 and 20240617](../2024-06-17-RNA-Quantification---C.gigas-RNA-Lifestage-Carryover-from-20240615-and-20240617/index.qmd) (Notebook)
- [20240618](../2024-06-18-RNA-Isolation-and-Quantification---C.gigas-Lifestage-Carryover-Seed-Juvenile-and-Adult/index.qmd) (Notebook)
- [20240701](../2024-07-01-RNA-Isolation-and-Quantification---C.gigas-Lifestage-Carryover-Seed-Juvenile-and-Adult/index.qmd) (Notebook)
