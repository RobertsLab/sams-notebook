# INTRO
Continuing work with [`project-gigas-carryover` lifestage_carryover](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-carryover/tree/main/lifestage_carryover) (GitHub repo) after [creating cDNA on 20241024](../2024-10-24-Reverse-Transcription---C.gigas-Lifestage-Carryover-RNA/index.qmd), it was finally time to run the qPCRs.

# MATERIALS & METHODS

Based on [results from an initial round of qPCRs on 20240327](../2024-03-27-qPCR-Analysis---C.gigas-Lifestages-Carryover-from-20240325/index.qmd) (Notebook entry), the following primer sets were selected:

| SR ID | Primer Name          |
|-------|----------------------|
| 1385  | Cg_ATPsynthase_F     |
| 1386  | Cg_ATPsynthase_R     |
| 1172  | Cg_GAPDH_205_F       |
| 1173  | Cg_GAPDH_355_R       |
| 1827  | Cg_cGAS_F            |
| 1826  | Cg_cGAS_R            |

All samples were run in triplicate, on low-profile, white 96-well plates (USA Scientific) in a CFX Connect (Bio-Rad) or CFX96 (Bio-Rad) real-time thermalcycler. All reactions consisted of the following:

| Component                                          | Stock Concentration | Volume (uL) |
|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| cDNA                                               | NA                  | 1           |
| SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR Green Supermix (BioRad) | 2x                  | 10          |
| P<sub>F</sub>                                      | 10uM                | 0.5         |
| P<sub>R</sub>                                      | 10uM                | 0.5         |
| H<sub>2</sub>O                                     | NA                  | 8           |
| TOTAL                                              |                     | 20          |

Master mixes were distributed across 2.5 plates for each primer set. No template controls (NTC) were loaded on on just one of the three plates (plate #3 in all instances).

For cycling parameters, plate layouts, etc. see the [RESULTS](#results) section below.


# RESULTS


## Summary

- `GAPDH`: Based on [previous qPCR results in the project](../2024-03-25-qPCRs---C.gigas-Lifestage-Carryover-cDNA/index.qmd) (Notebook entry), this is intended to serve as the normalizing gene in this experiment. Amplification and melt plots look fine. Late amplification in NTCs, but melt temp peak is noticeably lower than other amplicons. As such, this is not concerning. Technical reps look good.

::: {.callout-note}
Despite the apparent wide spread in Cq values, it should be noted that there are differences in the amount of RNA used to make cDNA, which could easily lead to such results.
:::

- `ATP Synthase`: Amplification and melt plots look good. No amplification in NTCs. Reps are tight.

- `cGAS`: Amplification and melt plots look good. Late amplification in NTCs, but melt temp peak is ~2<sup>o</sup>C lower than other amplicons... Might be some non-specific amplification? Reps are tight.
