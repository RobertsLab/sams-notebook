# INTRO

After [isolating gDNA on 20240712](../2024-07-12-DNA-Isolation-and-Quantification---Lake-Trout-Liver/index.qmd) (Notebook), the next step was to perform bisulfite conversion.

# METHODS

I used 500ng of gDNA from each sample for bisulfite conversion using the EZ DNA Methylation Lightning Kit (ZymoResearch), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Samples were eluted with 10uL of the M-Elution Buffer and stored @ -20<sup>o</sup>C in the same box as the source DNA.

Calculations for input DNA volumes are here:

# DICUSSION

Next step will be to perform qPCR to amplify the C1q gene using the [primers designed on 20240729](../2024-07-29-Primer-Design---Lake-Trout-C1q-Gene-Bisulfite-Sequencing-Primers-Using-Primer3/) (Notebook), for eventual sequencing.
