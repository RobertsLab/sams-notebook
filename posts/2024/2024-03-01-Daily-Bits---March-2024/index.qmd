## 20240306

### [CEABIGR](https://github.com/sr320/ceabigr) (GitHub repo)

- Lengthy meeting to work extensively on manuscript - primarily documenting where code/data came from and organizing repo.

## 20240305

- Dealt with a bunch of annoying ProCard reconciliation stuff.

## 20240304

### Miscellaneous

- Read the rest of "Tending Sweetgrass" section in "Braiding Sweetgrass".

- Dealt with certificate issues for Eagle and Gannet. Despite "renewing" them, the renewal "broke" `wget` (can no longer download _without_ the use of `--no-check-certificate` flag). Remembered that I'd had this issue before and tracked down a [notebook entry](../../2022/2022-04-02-Server-Maintenance---Fix-Server-Certificate-Authentication-Issues/index.qmd) that dealt with this issue. Needed to install intermediate certificates and that resolved the problem!

## 20240301

### Miscellaneous

- Renewed Eagle server SSL certificate.

- Renewed Gannet server SSL certificate.

- Science Hour

  - Steven out of town, no show by anyone else.

### [CEABIGR](https://github.com/sr320/ceabigr) (GitHub repo)

- Updated README files.
