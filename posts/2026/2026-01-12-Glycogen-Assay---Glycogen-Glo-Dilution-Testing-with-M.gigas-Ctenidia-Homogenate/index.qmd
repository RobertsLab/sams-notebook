# INTRO

This was the initial testing of the [Glycogen-Glo Assay (Promega)](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/blob/master/protocols/Commercial_Protocols/Promega_Glycogen_Glo_Assay.pdf) (GitHub; PDF) using _M.gigas_ (Pacific oyster) ctenidia homegenate from [20251210](../../2025/2025-12-10-Tissue-Collection-and-Homogenization---M.gigas-Ctenidia-for-Glycogen-Glo-Assay/index.qmd) (notebook entry).

The idea was to identify a range (i.e. a very rough min/max) of starting tissues amounts that will fall within the range of the Glycogen-Glo standard curves. Additionally, this was an initial walk-through of using this kit to help figure out a general protocol that identified any tips/tricks/pitfalls to aid in developing a Standard Operating Protocol (SOP) for the [Roberts Lab Handbook](https://robertslab.github.io/resources/).

The assay will assess both glycogen _and_ glucose content. The way the assay works is to convert any glycogen to glucose. As such, glucose levels also need to be assessed for each sample, in order to _subtract_ that background glucose and get accurate glycogen quantification.

Overall, this process did not go very smoothly, but did highlight several challenges that can be addressed in future runs. Granted, I feel like most of this was related to my personal screw ups, but these will still serve as good guidance on improving this protocol for others.

# MATERIALS & METHODS

## Sample Selection

Sample [A2](../../2025/2025-12-10-Tissue-Collection-and-Homogenization---M.gigas-Ctenidia-for-Glycogen-Glo-Assay/index.qmd) was selected due to it's large tissue amount (50mg). This would allow us to perform serial dilutions representing different starting tissue amounts (roughly).

## Assay Preparation

### Samples and Standard Curves

Per the manufacturer's recommendations, all reagents were thawed. After thawing, the Glucoamylase Buffer and Luciferin Detection Solution were kept at room temperature, while the remaining components, including the A2 sample, were kept on ice.

The assay was set up to measure the following:

- A2 _GLYCOGEN_ content in the following equivalent "tissue" concentrations:

    - Not diluted (ND), 25mg, 2.5mg, 0.25mg, 0.025mg, 0mg

- A2 _GLUCOSE_ content in the following equivalent "tissue" concentrations:

    - Not diluted (ND), 25mg, 2.5mg, 0.25mg, 0.025mg, 0mg

- GLYCOGEN Standard curve:

   - 20ug/uL, 2ug/mL, 0.2ug/uL, 0.02ug/uL, 0ug/uL

- GLUCOSE Standard curve:

    - 100mM, 10mM, 1mM, 01.mM, 0mM

All dilutions were performed using a 2:1:1 mixture of PBS, 0.3N HCl, and TRIS Buffer (the latter two are supplied with the kit).

The A2 dilutions were performed in duplicate; primarily due to my poor calculations on the amount of the dilution buffer needed. Ugh.

The standard curves were each performed in triplicate.


## Assay

Samples and standard curves were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. Theh plate used was a Costar 96-well, white, opaque, flat-bottom. 

Briefly, 25uL of sample/standard was added to wells (see the [plate layout below](#plate-layout)). For those samples/standards being assessed for glycogen, 25uL of glucoamylase digestion solution was added. For those samples/standards being assessed for just glucose, 25uL of _only_ Glucoamylase Buffer was added. The plate was loosely covered with aluminum foil to prevent light/debris from getting in the wells, gently shaken by hand for 60s, and incubated at room temp for 1hr. All wells were loaded individually.

After the initial incubation period, 50uL of glucose detection reagent was added to _ALL_ wells using an Eppendorf repeater pipette (Repeater M4). The plate was loosely covered with aluminum foil to prevent light/debris from getting in the wells, gently shaken by hand for 60s, and incubated at room temp for 1hr.

After incubating, luminescence was measured on the Roberts Lab Synergy HTX (Agilent) with the Gen5 software (Agilent).
