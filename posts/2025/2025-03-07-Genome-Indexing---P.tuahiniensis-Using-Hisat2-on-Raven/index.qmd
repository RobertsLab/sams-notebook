# INTRO

In preparation for RNA-seq analysis for [urol-e5/timeseries_molecular](https://github.com/urol-e5/timeseries_molecular) (GitHub repo) project, we needed to index the genome using [`HISAT2`](https://daehwankimlab.github.io/hisat2/). I had [previously fixed the GFF and prepared a corresponding GTF on ]() so that we could identify exons splice sites - both of which are useful during genome indexing to identify alternative isoforms in downstream applications.
