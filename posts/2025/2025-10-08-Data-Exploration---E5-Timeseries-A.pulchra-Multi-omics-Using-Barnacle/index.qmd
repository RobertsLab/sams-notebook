# INTRO

This notebook is an introductory exploration of the E5 coral [`urol-e5/timeseries_molecular`](https://github.com/urol-e5/timeseries_molecular) (GitHub repo) multi-species data using a tensor decomposition approach, using [barnacle](https://github.com/blasks/barnacle) (GitHub Repo). Of note, using [barnacle](https://github.com/blasks/barnacle) (GitHub Repo) for this multi-omics analysis greatly differs than the analysis I messed around with using [MOFA2](https://biofam.github.io/MOFA2/index.html).

[Barnacle](https://github.com/blasks/barnacle) (GitHub Repo) utilizes tensor decomposition. As such, the analysis is constrained, due to the fact that the tensors must have the same dimensions as each other. [MOFA2](https://biofam.github.io/MOFA2/index.html) is not limited by data dimensionality. So, for this barnacle analysis, we're only using gene expression as a metric, with the goal being to identify genes/components (factors) which
