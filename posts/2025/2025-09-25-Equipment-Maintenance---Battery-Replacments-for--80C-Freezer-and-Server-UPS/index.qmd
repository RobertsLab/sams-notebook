# INTRO

Replaced the battery in our -80C feezer (VWR) with a new one (Power Sonic PS-1270 Rechargeable Sealed Lead Acid Battery 12V 7AH for General Purpose, Medical, Emergency Lighting, Fire and Security with F1 Terminals).

Replaced the batteries in our APC Universal Power Supply (UPS) that powers our servers (Gannet/Owl).
