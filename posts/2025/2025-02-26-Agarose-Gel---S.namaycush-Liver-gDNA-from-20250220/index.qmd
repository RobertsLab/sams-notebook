# INTRO

After isolating and quantifying gDNA from Lake trout liver on [20250220](../2025-02-20-DNA-Isolation-and-Quantification---S.namaycush-Liver/index.qmd) (Notebook entry), I needed to evaluate its integrity, so ran it on an agarose gel.

# MATERIALS & METHODS

100ng of each sample were run on 0.8% agarose, 1x TAE gel with ethidium bromide. I prepared the DNA for loading by combining each sample with 1uL of [6x Orange DNA Loading Dye (Thermo Scientific)](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/R0631) and water to a final volume of 6uL. The gel was run @ 107V for ~45mins and then imaged.

[O'GeneRuler DNA Ladder Mix, Ready-to-Use 100-10,00bp (Thermo Scientific)](https://www.fishersci.se/shop/products/fermentas-o-generuler-ready-to-use-dna-ladder-mix/11803983) was used (5uL) for size reference:

# RESULTS

# DISCUSSION

Most samples have a faint, but visible high molecular weight band indicating high quality, intact gDNA. Sample 92 shows smearing, indicating degradation. Sample 93 shows no DNA. Will pass info along to Steven to determine if samples can be submitted for sequencing, as indicated in [the DNA isolation notebook from 20250220](../2025-02-20-DNA-Isolation-and-Quantification---S.namaycush-Liver/index.qmd) (Notebook entry).
