# INTRO

The [Glycogen-Glo (Promega) Kit]() (GitHub; PDF) recommends aliquotting all components, in order to reduce freeze/thaw cycles. Freeze/thaw cycles are recommended to be held to less than three.

# MATERIALS & METHODS

I aliquotted all components, excluding the glycogen and glucose, into volumes representing ~25 reactions. I selected this aliquot amount, based on my assumptions of what a common number of samples, including standard curves, would generally be run; including running samples/curves in triplicate.

Each component was aliquoted and stored in a dedicated box.

::: {.callout-important}
Tubes were _not_ labelled! Pay attention when removing, so as to not mix confuse them with other components!
:::

The reductase was stored in the middle -80<sup>o</sup>C freezer, on the bottom shelf.

All other components were stored in the -20<sup>o</sup>C freezer in FTR 209.

::: {.callout-note}
The glycogen and glucose were stored in the original Glycogen-Glo kit box.
