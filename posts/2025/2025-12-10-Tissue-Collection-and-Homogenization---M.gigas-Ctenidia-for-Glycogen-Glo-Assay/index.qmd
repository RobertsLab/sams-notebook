# INTRO

As part of a post-treatment temperature survival trial with Westcott [Pacific oysters (_Crassostrea gigas_)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_oyster) (Wikipedia), Ariana collected ctenidia tissue from 39 oysters for a resazurin assay. Steven asked that I collect ctenidia tissue from the same oysters for assessing glycogen content.

This is part of the [`sormi-assay-development`](https://github.com/RobertsLab/sormi-assay-development) (GitHub repo).

# MATERIALS & METHODS

## Ctenidia Sampling

Oysters were shucked by Ariana and she collected ctenidia samples for her resazurin assays from a total of 39 oysters. After she shucked 16 oysters, I collected and weighed ctenidia tissues for the glycogen assay. Tubes had been previously filled with homogenization buffer (see [Homogenization section](#homogenization) below). This was repeated until all 39 were samples. Samples were stored on ice prior to homogenization.

Sample labels were plate IDs (e.g. A1, A2, A3, etc.) which were tied to Ariana's resazuring assay.

Weights were to the nearest milligram.

## Homogenization

The [Glycogen-Glo Kit](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/blob/master/protocols/Commercial_Protocols/Promega_Glycogen_Glo_Assay.pdf) (Promega; PDF) will be used for quantifying glycogen in the ctenidia samples. Ctenidia tissues were processed in 1.5mL Safe-Lock snap cap tubes (Qiagen):

- 500uL PBS
- 250uL 0.3N HCl
- ~300uL 0.5mm glass beads

Samples were homogenized in a pre-cooled (dry ice) Bullet Blender Gold 5+, using the 1.5mL tube adapters. Samples were processed at Speed 12 for 4mins. After homogenization, add 250uL of Tris buffer to each, vortexed, and stored @ -20<sup>o</sup>C.

::: {.callout-warning}
The following samples seemed to have lost buffer during homogenization (which is weird). An additional 500uL of PBS was added, but probably won't help due to the required pH needed for the luciferin component of the assay:

- B7
- C8
- D7
