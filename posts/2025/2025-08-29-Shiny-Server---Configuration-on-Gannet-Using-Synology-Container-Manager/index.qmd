# INTRO
Steven has created a [Shiny app](https://shiny.posit.co/) (website) that will allow the public to plot/interact with some of the resazurin data that the lab's been collecting. He [assigned me to tackle getting a Shiny server set up on one our lab servers](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/2302) so that we don't have to rely on free options, which can be limited.



Volume mounting:

```
/volume2/docker/shiny-verse/vims-resazurin-main/:/srv/shiny-server
/volume2/docker/shiny-verse/vims-resazurin-main/code/shiny-app/app.R:/srv/shiny-server/resazurin
```

Install required packages.

```
