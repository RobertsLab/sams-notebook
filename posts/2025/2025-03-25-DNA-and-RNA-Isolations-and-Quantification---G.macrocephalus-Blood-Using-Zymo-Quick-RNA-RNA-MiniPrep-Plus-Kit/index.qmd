# INTRO

# MATERIALS & METHODS

## DNA & RNA Isolations

I used the [Quick-DNA/RNA MiniPrep Plus Kit (ZymoResearch)](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/blob/master/protocols/Commercial_Protocols/ZymoResearch_quick-dna-rna-_miniprep_plus_kit-d7003-20250325.pdf) (PDF; GitHub) to isolate DNA and RNA from Pacific cod samples (see [RESULTS](#results) for list of samples), according to the manufacturer's protocol for whole blood, with the following modifications:

- After the initial addition of isopropanol to the samples (Step 3), I pelleted unlysed cells/debris by spinning 30s at 16,000g. The resulting supernatant was transferred to the columns.


- The optional DNase step _was_ used in the RNA isolation protocol. Both DNA and RNA were each eluted with 50uL of H<sub>2</sub>O.

::: {.callout-note}
Due to heavy coagulation, after the initial addition of DNA/RNA Shield, I attempted to physically disrupt the coagulated blood using disposable pestles. However, this did not seem to have much of an effect.

## Quantification

DNA was quantified using the Qubit 1x dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay (Invitrogen). 1uL of each DNA sample was used.


RNA was quantified using the Qubit RNA High Sensitivity Assay (Invitrogen). 1uL of each RNA sample was used.

DNA and RNA were both stored @ -80<sup>o</sup>C in the box: `P.cod Blood DNA/RNA #1`. This has been temporarily stored in the middle -80<sup>o</sup>C freezer until space becomes available in the Roberts Lab -80<sup>o</sup>C freezer.
