# INTRO
We received PacBio data back from Angie Shmoldt at the Univ. of Wisconsin-Milwaukee as part of Rick's [_Salvelinus namaycush_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_trout) sequencing project.

Data was downloaded and [MD5 checksums were verified](#checksum-verification).

::: {.callout-note}
Data was downloaded via `sftp` using the program `lftp`, as it was the only way I could figure out how to recursively download the data via command line (SSH access was not an option). Here's the example:

```bash
lftp sftp://user@hostname
lftp> mirror /remote/directory /local/destination/
```

Data is available here:

## Data

There are two "pools" of data, which exist as BAM files:

- Pool 1

  - BAM

    - [https://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/S_namaycush/LakeTrout/Pool1/hifi_reads$ md5sum m84082_250614_081210_s3.hifi_reads.bam](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/S_namaycush/LakeTrout/Pool1/hifi_reads$ md5sum m84082_250614_081210_s3.hifi_reads.bam) (22GB)

## Checksum verification

No MD5 checksums were provided, however, the files were hosted on a Synology server, so I was able to generate checksums using the web interface. I manually compared those with the checksums I generated for the files once they were on Owl.
