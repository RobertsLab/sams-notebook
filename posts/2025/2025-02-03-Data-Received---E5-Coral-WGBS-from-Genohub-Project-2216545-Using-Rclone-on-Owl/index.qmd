# INTRO

Whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data was received from Genohub for Project 2216545. Genohub provided Amazon AWS S3 credentials for downloading. Installation of the AWS command line interface (CLI) was a bit too involved to try to figure out on Owl (our Synology server), which might be BSD Linux? Instead, I installed and configured [rclone](https://rclone.org/) on Owl.

# METHODS

## Configuring Rclone

Installation was a breeze. SSH'd into and then used the following command provided on the [rclone Downloads page](https://rclone.org/downloads/):

`sudo -v ; curl https://rclone.org/install.sh | sudo bash`

I performed the initial configuration step using the credentials supplied by Genohub.

- `rclone config`

Then, I ran the list command to view the contents of the S3 bucket on AWS:

`rclone ls remote:`

However, this did _not_ work!

```
2025/02/03 12:57:43 NOTICE: Failed to ls: operation error S3: ListBuckets, https response error StatusCode: 403, RequestID: SH6FBZZSFZVEFBMG, HostID: <redacted>, api error AccessDenied: User: arn:aws:iam::<redacted>:user/remote is not authorized to perform: s3:ListAllMyBuckets because no identity-based policy allows the s3:ListAllMyBuckets action
```

After some sleuthing in the Genohub documentation for using the AWS CLI, I realized I needed to specify the S3 bucket. In order to specify an S3 bucket with rclone, you need to [create an rclone alias](https://rclone.org/alias/) - you cannot configure S3 to access a bucket directory.

So, I set up an alias with rclone:

1. Run `rclone config`

2. Specify `n) New remote`

3. `name> genohub`

4. Specify `alias` as storage type:

    ```
    Type of storage to configure.
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value

    >alias
    ```

5. ```remote> remote:genohub_bucket``` 

::: {.callout-note}
You need to replace `<genohub_bucket>` with the actual bucket ID provided by Genohub.
:::

6. Save the configuration at the prompt.

Then, you can actually access your data using the alias `genohub`:

`rclone ls genohub:`

# DATA

All files were downloaded to `owl:/volume1/web/nightingales/E5-coral-time-series/genohub2216545` and MD5 checksums verified:
