# INTRO

We received WGBS data from Psomagen Project AN00025267.

Libraries were prepared using Accel-NGS Methyl-Seq DNA Library Kit EZ DNA Methylation-Gold Kit (Zymo Research).

Data was downloaded to Owl and [MD5 checksums were verified](#checksum-verification).


Data is available here:

- [https://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/G_macrocephalus/AN00025267/](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/G_macrocephalus/AN00025267/)



An interactive sequencing report is available here:
