# INTRO

We received RNA-seq data from Psomagen Project AN00025267.


Data was downloaded to Owl and [MD5 checksums were verified](#checksum-verification).


Data is available here:

- [https://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/G_macrocephalus/AN00025267/](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/G_macrocephalus/AN00025268/)



An interactive sequencing report is available here:
