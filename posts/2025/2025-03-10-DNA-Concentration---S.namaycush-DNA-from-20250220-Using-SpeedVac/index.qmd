# INTRO

I had previously isolate [_Salvelinus namaycush_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_trout) (Wikipedia) liver gDNA on [](../2025-02-20-DNA-Isolation-and-Quantification---S.namaycush-Liver/index.qmd). Steven asked me [to concentrate the gDNA](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/2079#issuecomment-2708916009) (GitHub Issue) to ~800 - 1000ng/uL, per a request of the sequencing facility.

# MATERIALS & METHODS

All samples were concentrated in a SpeedVac, under vacuum, at the medium heat setting. The samples were monitored periodically to ensure they did not dry out completely. Once the sample volumes were reduced to ~10uL (this would concentrate all the samples ~4X which should achieve the target concentrations ). The process took ~5hrs. The samples were removed and stored at -20Â°C until further use.
