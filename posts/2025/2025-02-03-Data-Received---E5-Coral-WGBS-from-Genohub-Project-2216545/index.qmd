# INTRO

Whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data was received from Genohub for Project 2216545. Genohub provided Amazon AWS S3 credentials for downloading. Installation of the AWS command line interface (CLI) was a bit too involved to try to figure out on Owl (our Synology server), which might be BSD Linux? Instead, I installed and configured [rclone](https://rclone.org/) on Owl.
