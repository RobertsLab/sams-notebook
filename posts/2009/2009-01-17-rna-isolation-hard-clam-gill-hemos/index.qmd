RNA was isolated from hard clam gill (0.08g; from [20090109](../2009-01-09-bleeding-hard-clams-3/index.qmd)) and from hard clam hemos (from [20090114](../2009-01-14-bleeding-hard-clams/index.qmd)). One "unknown" sample (from 20090114) was also processed. Pellets were resuspended in 50uL of 0.1%DEPC-H2O. Hemo samples were pooled. Samples were spec'd.

Results: 260/280 looks OK for hemos. The gill sample has excellent 260/280 and pretty good 260/230. Samples will be reprecipitated over the weekend @ -20C according to Ambion PolyA Purist protocol in preparation for mRNA isolation.
