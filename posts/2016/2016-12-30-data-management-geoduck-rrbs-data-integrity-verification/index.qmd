[Yesterday, I downloaded the Illumina FASTQ files provided by Genewiz](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/posts/2016/2016-12-30-data-received-geoduck-rrbs-sequencing-data/) for Hollie Putnam's reduced representation bisulfite geoduck libraries. However, Genewiz had not provided a checksum file at the time.

I received the checksum file from Genewiz and have verified that the data is intact. Verification is described in the Jupyter notebook below.

Data files are located here: [owl/web/nightingales/P_generosa](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/P_generosa/)
