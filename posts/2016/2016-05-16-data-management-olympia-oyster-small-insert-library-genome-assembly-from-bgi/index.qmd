Received another set of _Ostrea lurida_ genome assembly data from BGI. In this case, it's data assembled from the small insert libraries they created for this project.

All data is stored here: [https://owl.fish.washington.edu/O_lurida_genome_assemblies_BGI/20160512/](http://owl.fish.washington.edu/O_lurida_genome_assemblies_BGI/20160512/)

They've provided a [Genome Survey](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/O_lurida_genome_assemblies_BGI/20160512/20160512_F15FTSUSAT0327_genome_survey.pdf)  (PDF) that has some info about the data they've assembled. In it, is the estimated genome size:

Olympia oyster genome size: 1898.92 Mb

Additionally, there's a table breaking down the N50 distributions of scaffold and contig sizes.

Data management stuff was performed in a Jupyter (iPython) notebook; see below.
