Finally running some analysis on the [output from my PyRad analysison 20160727](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/posts/2016/2016-07-27-data-analysis-pyrad-analysis-of-olympia-oyster-gbs-data/).

I'm following Katherine Silliman's Jupyter notebook ([2bRAD Subset Population Structure Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/ksil91/2016_Notebook/blob/master/2bRAD%20Subset%20Population%20Structure%20Analysis.ipynb)) as a guide.

The initial analysis (which isn't much) is in the Jupyter notebook below. The analysis will be continued on a later date.

Jupyter notebook: [20161117_docker_oly_vcf_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/sr320/LabDocs/blob/master/jupyter_nbs/sam/20161117_docker_oly_vcf_analysis.ipynb)

I've embedded the notebook below, but it's much easier to view (there are many lengthy commands/filenames that wrap lines in the embedded version below) the actual file linked above.
