After completing the downloads of these files from BGI, I needed to verify that the downloaded copies matched the originals. Below is a Jupyter Notebook detailing how I verified file integrity via MD5 checksums. It also highlights the importance of doing this check when working with large sequencing files (or, just large files in general), as a few of them had mis-matching MD5 checksums!

Although the notebook is embedded below, it might be easier viewing via the notebook link (hosted on GitHub).

At the end of the day, I had to re-download some files, but all the MD5 checksums match and these data are ready for analysis:

[Final _Ostrea lurida_ genome files](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/O_lurida_genome_assemblies_BGI/20161201/cdts-hk.genomics.cn/Ostrea_lurida/)

[Final _Panopea generosa_ genome files](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/P_generosa_genome_assemblies_BGI/20161201/cdts-hk.genomics.cn/Panopea_generosa/)
