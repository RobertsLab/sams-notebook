After some basal readings about what Fst is (see notebook below for a definition and reference), I decided to try to use [fastStructure](https://rajanil.github.io/fastStructure/) to analyze the PyRAD output from [20160727](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/posts/2016/2016-07-27-data-analysis-pyrad-analysis-of-olympia-oyster-gbs-data/).

The quick, TL;DR: after spending a bunch of time installing the program, it doesn't handle the default Structure file (.str); requires some companion file types that PyRAD doesn't output.

I've put this here for posterity and background reference on Fst...

Will proceed with using the full blown Structure program to try to glean some info from these three populations.
