We received info to download the final data and genome assembly files for geoduck and Olympia oyster from BGI.

In total, the downloads took a little over three days to complete!

The notebook detailing how the files were downloaded is below, but it should be noted that [I had to strip the output cells](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/posts/2016/2016-12-14-data-managment-trim-output-cells-from-jupyter-notebook/) because the output from the download command made the file too large to upload to GitHub, and the size of the notebook file would constantly crash the browser/computer that it was opened in. So, the notebook below is here for posterity.
