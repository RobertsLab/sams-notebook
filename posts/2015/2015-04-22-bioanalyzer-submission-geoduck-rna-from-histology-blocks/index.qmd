Submitted 3Î¼L (~75ng) of RNA from each of [the two gonad samples isolated from foot tissue embedded in paraffin histology blocks 20150409](../2015-04-09-rna-isolation-geoduck-foot-in-paraffin-histology-blocks/index.qmd) (to assess quality of RNA) to Jesse Tsai at University of Washington Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Science Functional Genomics Laboratory:




    
  * Geoduck Block 34

    
  * Geoduck Block 42



Jesse will determine if the samples should be run on the RNA Pico or the RNA Nano chips.
