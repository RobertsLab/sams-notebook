Continued Illumina library prep of bisulfite-treated DNA samples (400ppm and 1000ppm; from [20150115](../2015-01-13-speedvac-c-gigas-larvae-oa-dna/index.qmd)) with [Methylamp DNA Modification Kit (Epigentek)](https://github.com/sr320/LabDocs/blob/master/protocols/Commercial_Protocols/Epigentek_PostBisulfiteIlluminaLibraryPrep_P-1055.pdf) (PDF). Performed bead clean up immediately after End Repair.

PCR cycles: 14

No other changes were made to the manufacturer's protocol.

Epigentek Barcode Indices assigned, per their recommendations for using two libraries for multiplexing:

400ppm - barcode #6 - GCCAAT

1000ppm - barcode #12 - CTTGTA

The two libraries were stored @ -20C and will be quantified tomorrow.
