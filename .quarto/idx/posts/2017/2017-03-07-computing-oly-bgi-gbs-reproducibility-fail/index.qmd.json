I've contacted BGI to get some help on this.\n\nIn the meantime, here's a brief (actually, not as brief as I'd like) rundown of my struggles.\n\nThe demultiplexing software that BGI used is something called \"iTools\" which is bundled in this GitHub repo: [Resqtools](https://github.com/BGI-shenzhen/Reseqtools)\n\nTo demutliplex, they ran a script called: [split.sh](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/O_lurida/20160223_gbs/split.sh)\n\nThe script seems fairly straightforward. Here is what it contains:\n\n\n    \n    <code>iTools Fqtools splitpool \\\n    -InFq1 160123_I132_FCH3YHMBBXX_L4_OYSzenG1AAD96FAAPEI-109_1.fq.gz \\\n    -InFq2 160123_I132_FCH3YHMBBXX_L4_OYSzenG1AAD96FAAPEI-109_2.fq.gz \\\n    -Index index.lst \\\n    -Flag enzyme.txt \\\n    -MisMatch \\\n    -OutDir split\n    </code>\n\n\n\nIt tells the iTools program to use the Fqtools tool \"splitpool\" to operate on a pair of gzipped FASTQ files. It also utilizes an index file ([index.lst](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/O_lurida/20160223_gbs/index.lst)) which contains all the barcodes needed to identify, and separate, the individual samples that were combined prior to sequencing.\n\nThe first bump in the road is the `-Flag enzyme.txt` portion of the code. BGI did not provide me with this file. I recently requested them to send me it (or its contents, since I suspected it was only a single line text file). They sent me the contents of the file:\n\n\n    \n    <code>CAGC\n    CTGC</code>\n\n\n\nThe next problem is neither of those two sequences are the recognition site for the enzyme that was (supposedly) used: ApeKI. The recognition site for ApeKI is: GCWGC\n\nRegardless, I decided to see if I could reproduce the demultiplexing using the info they'd provided me.\n\nI cloned the [Resqtools](https://github.com/BGI-shenzhen/Reseqtools) repo, changed into the Reseqtools/iTools directory and typed `make`.\n\nThis resulted in an error informing me that it could not find `boost/spirit/core.hpp`\n\nI tracked down the [Boost](https://www.boost.org/) library junk, downloaded the newest version and untarred it in /usr/local/bin.\n\nTried to run `make` in the Reseqtools/iTools directory and got the same error. Realized iTools might not be searching the system `$PATH` (this turned out to be correct), so I moved the contents of the Boost folder to the iTools, ran `make` and got the same error. Turns out, the newest version of Boost doesn't have that `core.hpp` file any more. Looking at the iTools documentation, iTools was built around Boost 1.44. OMG...\n\nDownloaded Boost 1.44 and went through the same steps as above. This eliminated the missing `core.hpp` error!\n\nBut, of course, led to another error. The error:\n\n\n    \n    <code>\"Threading support unavaliable: it has been explicitly disabled with BOOST_DISABLE_THREADS\"</code>\n\n\n\nThat was related to something with newer versions of the GCC compiler (this is, essentially, built into the computer; it's not worth trying to install/use old versions of GCC) trying to work with old versions of Boost. Found a patch for a config file here: (dead url - svn.boost.org/trac/boost/attachment/ticket/6165/libstdcpp3.hpp.patch)\n\nI made the appropriate edits to the file as shown in that link and ran `make` and it almost worked!\n\nThe current error is:\n\n\n    \n    <code>./src/Variants/soapsv-v1.02/include.h:15:16: fatal error: gd.h: No such file or directory</code>\n\n\n\nI gave up and contacted BGI to see if they can get me a functional version of iTools...\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nSince we're preparing a manuscript that relies on BGI's manipulation/handling of the genotype-by-sequencing data, I attempted to could reproduce the demultiplexing steps that BGI used in order to perform the SNP/genotyping on these samples.\n\nThe key word in the above sentence is \"attempted.\" Ugh, what a massive waste of time it turned out to be.
