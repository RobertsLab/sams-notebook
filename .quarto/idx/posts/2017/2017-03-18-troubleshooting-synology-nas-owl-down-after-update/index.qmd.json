Inaccessible data is mostly from individual user directories.\n\nAll high-throughput sequencing is also backed up to Amazon Glacier, so we do have all of that data.\n\n\n\nHere is what happened, in chronological order:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n  1. Updated DSM via web interface in \"Update & Restore\". Did NOT perform manual install.\n\n    \n  2. System became inaccessible via web interface and Synology Assistant.\n\n    \n  3. The physical unit showed blue, flashing power light and green flashing LAN1 light.\n\n    \n  4. No other lights were illuminated (this includes no lights for any of the drive bays).\n\n    \n  5. The attached expansion unit (DX513) showed steady blue power light, steady green lights on all drive bays, and steady green eSATA light.\n\n    \n  6. I powered down both units via the DS1812+ power button.\n\n    \n  7. I turned on the both units via the DS1812+ power button.\n\n    \n  8. Both units returned to their previous status and were still inaccessible via the web interface and Synology Assistant.\n\n    \n  9. I powered down both units via the DS1812+ power button.\n\n    \n  10. I removed all drives from both units.\n\n    \n  11. I turned on the both units via the DS1812+ power button.\n\n    \n  12. I connected to the DS1812+ via Synology Assistant. A message indicated \"No Hard Disk Found on 1812+\".\n\n    \n  13. I powered down both units via the DS1812+ power button.\n\n    \n  14. I added a single HDD to the DS1812+.\n\n    \n  15. I turned on the both units via the DS1812+ power button.\n\n    \n  16. I connected to the DS1812+ via Synology Assistant. I was prompted to install the latest DSM. I followed the steps and created a new admin account. Now the system shows 7 drives in the DS1812+ with a message: \"System Partition Failed; Healthy\". Disk 1 shows a \"Normal\" status; this is the disk that I used to re-install DSM in Step 14. Additionally, the system shows one unused disk in the DX513.\n\n    \n  17. I powered down both units via the web interface.\n\n    \n  18. I removed Disk 1 from DS1812+.\n\n    \n  19. I turned on the both units via the DS1812+ power button.\n\n    \n  20. The DS1812+ returns to its initial state as described in Step 3.\n\n    \n  21. I powered down both units via the DS1812+ power button.\n\n    \n  22. I returned Disk 1 to its bay.\n\n    \n  23. I turned on the both units via the DS1812+ power button.\n\n    \n  24. There's an option to \"Repair\" the Volume, but I'm not comfortable doing so until I discuss the in/outs of this with Synology.
