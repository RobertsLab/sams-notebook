I noticed that [the link for the software in the original Tweet](ftp://ftp.genome.umd.edu/pub/MaSuRCA/latest/) had a parent directory, so I navigated there and spotted this:\n\nQuick start guide (PDF): [ftp://ftp.genome.umd.edu/pub/MaSuRCA/MaSuRCA_QuickStartGuide.pdf](ftp://ftp.genome.umd.edu/pub/MaSuRCA/MaSuRCA_QuickStartGuide.pdf)\n\nAlthough not a big deal, this quick start guide is for the previous version (v.3.2.2).\n\nSo, is this where we get to the \"super easy to use\" part?

Run the `masurca` script (located here: `MaSuRCA-3.2.3/bin/masurca`). This will generate a new script (called `assemble.sh`).\n\n\n\n  3.
