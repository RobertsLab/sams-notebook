Gigas gill protein extracts from 20080617 (both control and Vibrio exposure samples) were each pooled to result in 10ug protein of control and 10ug protein of VE in a volume of 10uL each. The two samples were mixed with an equal volume of 2x sample reducing buffer. O. rubescans samples were taken from Rachel's -20C box. 15uL of each sample was mixed with 2x sample reducing buffer. All samples were boiled for 5mins and spot spun. Samples were loaded onto Pierce 4-20% Tris-Glycine SDS/PAGE gels. 10uL of SeeBlue ladder was loaded. Gel was run @ 150V for 45mins.\n\nGel was transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (equilibrated in tris-glycine transfer buffer for 5mins) @15V for 20mins.
