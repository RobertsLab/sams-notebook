Looking at the gel above and comparing sample band intensity to the ladder band intensities suggests that the downtown sequencing facility is correct. I loaded 10uL of DNA on the gel and the intensity of the high molecular weight band is similar to the 400bp band intensity. This corresponds to 40ng of DNA. That means the CgF gDNA band is 40ng/10uL = 4ng/uL.

Until very recently, there were almost never such egregious differences between the NanoDrop measurements and what they were measuring downtown at the sequencing facility. It seems as though they have changed the way they quantify samples (possibly using an Agilent Bioanalyzer instead of the Life Technologies Qubit fluorometer?), but this doesn't mean their measurements are incorrect. However, I'm starting to suspect that the reason the initial sequencing of this sample was due to an overestimation of the quantity of input DNA (since I believe they were still using the fluorometer back then).\n\nAs such, it's become clear that C.gigas gonad samples seem to yield poor quantities of gDNA, relative to the amount of input material.
