Liver tissues had been stored @ -20<sup>o</sup>C in RNALater (Ambion).

DNA was eventually eluted with 50uL of Elution Buffer.\n\nSubsequently, DNA was quantified using the 1x dsDNA Broad Range Qubit Assay (ThermoFisher). One microliter of sample was combined with 199uL of the dye/buffer mix and measured on a Qubit 3.0.\n\nDNA was stored in a box labelled \"Lake Trout Liver gDNA\" in the FTR 209 -20<sup>o</sup>C freezer.\n\n## Agarose gel\n\nApproximately 0.1uL of each sample was run an a 0.8% low-TAE agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide. This was done just to spot check samples and I wasn't concerned about loading exact quantities of DNA (or equal quantities) across samples.
