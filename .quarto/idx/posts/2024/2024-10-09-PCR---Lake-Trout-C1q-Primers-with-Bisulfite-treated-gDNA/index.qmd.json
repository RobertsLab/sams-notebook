So, just for kicks, we decided to try running a PCR with the regular C1q primers and the bisulfite-treated gDNA.\n\n## MATERIALS & METHODS\n\n### DNA Pooling\n\nUsed 0.5uL of the pooled gDNA in each reaction.\n\n### PCR Reactions\n\nPCR reactions were run using [EpiMark Hot Start Taq DNA Polymerase](https://www.neb.com/en-us/products/m0490-epimark-hot-start-taq-dna-polymerase) (New England Biolabs), according to the [manufacturer's protocol](https://www.neb.com/en-us/protocols/2012/09/25/epimark-hot-start-taq-dna-polymerase-guidelines-for-pcr-reactions-m0490), in a total reaction volume of 25uL.\n\nI ran the reaction in duplicate, using 0.5uL of the pooled liver gDNA for template. Each reaction was prepared *individually* (i.e. no master mix was created).\n\nPrimers used:\n\n-   `Sn-C1q-F/R` (SRIDs: 1842/3)\n\n### PCR Cycling\n\nAnnealing temperature gradient PCR was performed in a CFX Connect (BioRad) thermalcycler.\n\nCycling params:\n\n![Screenshot of cycling program, also sdhowing temperature gradient.](./202401009-snam-c1q-BS-DNA-pcr.png){#fig-PCR-parameters fig-alt=\"PCR cycling parameters.\"}\n\n1.  95<sup>o</sup>C - 30s\n2.  95<sup>o</sup>C - 15s\n3.  55<sup>o</sup>C - 30s\n4.  68<sup>o</sup>C - 4m\n5.

Most DNA polymerases (including [EpiMark Hot Start Taq DNA Polymerase](https://www.neb.com/en-us/products/m0490-epimark-hot-start-taq-dna-polymerase)) process 1Kbp/min, so setting to four mins is a tad long, but will certainly ensure the full gene length is amplified.\n:::\n\nPCR reactions were loaded on a low-TAE, 1.0% agarose gel, with ethidium bromide.

It did not.\n\nIn retrospect, we probably shouldn't have had *any* expectations this would work. The reasons for this are related to the amount of DNA fragmentation/degradation that takes place during bisulfite treatment of gDNA. I was certainly aware of the fact that bisulfite treatement was considered \"harsh\" and resulted in single-stranded gDNA, as well as some degradation. However, after some investigation into this (spurred by the results of this project), it's clear that the degradation that occurs is high! High enough, in fact, one is unlikely to ever expect any successful PCR of products larger than \\~2,000bp.\n\nAs an example, [ZymoResearch's \"Bisulfite Beginner Guide\"](https://www.zymoresearch.com/pages/bisulfite-beginner-guide) (ZymoResearch website), provides an example gel to display the level of degradation expected from bisulfite treatment of gDNA. Keep in mind, companies usually display their *best* examples:\n\n![Screencapture from ZymoResearch website of a two gel images showing bisulfite gDNA. The gel image on the left has been run under normal circumstances. The gel on the right shows the same gel, but after cooling in an ice bath; allowing the DNA to form enough base pairing to allow the ethidium bromide to intercalate the DNA.](./zymo-bs-dna-gel.png){.lightbox fig-alt=\"Screencapture from ZymoResearch website of a two gel images showing bisulfite gDNA.

This means the highest molecular weight band in the marker corresponds to 1500bp! That means our attempts to potentially amplify a \\~3,200bp from bisulfite-treated gDNA were virtually impossible to achieve.\n\nAlso, as part of my research into the impacts of bisulfite degradation on gDNA, I came acroos this excellent paper ([\"Evaluation of bisulfite kits for DNA methylation profiling in terms of DNA fragmentation and DNA recovery using digital PCR \"](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0199091)) [@kint2018] which compares the performance of multiple bisulfite treatment kits, including:\n\n-   recovery (yield)\n-   recovery integrity\n-   processing time\n\nThe combination of information from that ZymoResearch site and the paper make it pretty clear that PCR of a product size of ~3,200bp would not happen.
