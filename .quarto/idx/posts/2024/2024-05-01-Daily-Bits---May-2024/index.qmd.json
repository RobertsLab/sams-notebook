Seems like there's a necessary order of operations (start VMs first, then insert mic).

Fedora is the only one which will start.\n\n  - This issue seems like it might be related to a new microphone I am trying to use (Rode VideoMic GO II) and/or the Rode Connect software! I'm unable to open Windows 10 \"Sound Settings\" - it just hangs at the blue screen with the gear icon. Additionally, when the microphone is unplugged, things all seem to operate completely normally!
