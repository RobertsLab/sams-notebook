Still dealing with some minor file output organization issues... Also, seems like `fastp` is trimming data (i.e. output reports indicate average read length _after_ filtering is ~140bp, but the resulting graphs of read lengths after trimming still show 150bp...).\n\n\n\n20230119\n\n- Ran QC/trimming SLURM script for coral SRA data (BioProject [PRJNA74403](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA744403)).\n\n  - Took ~ 10.5hrs, but needed some adjustments...\n\n- Pub-a-thon\n\n\n\n20230118\n\n- Continued work on [this Issue](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/1569) (GitHub Issue) for dealing with coral SRA data (BioProject [PRJNA74403](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA744403)).\n\n  - `gzip`-ed all the data.\n\n  - Continued working on script to trim data.\n\n\n\n20230117\n\n- Lab meeting.\n\n- Continued work on [this Issue](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/1569) (GitHub Issue) for dealing with coral SRA data (BioProject [PRJNA74403](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA744403)).\n\n  - Continued working on script to trim data.\n\n\n\n\n20230113\n\n- Made some scatter plots from the CEABIGR mean gene methylation coefficients of variation calcs. Not sure if they're useful or not, but here are some of them (animated GIF - changes every ~4s). Animated GIF cycling through scatter plots of different comparisions of mean gene methylation coefficients of variation (CoV).

I think that was crucial, as I was getting the `delta` column by itself as the result, but wasn't getting the full data frames with the new `delta` column added to them.\n\n\n\n20230111\n\n- Messed around with plotting CEABIGR mean gene methylation CoV, via scatter plots. Trying to decide if this method provides any info or not. Also tried to figure out how to plot all data frames, as they are stored in a list.\n\n\n\n20230110\n\n- Worked extensively on troubleshooting \"missing\" row names in a list of data frames in CEABIGR project for coefficients of variaton of mean DNA methylation.\n\n  - Turns out, the row names _were_ present the entire time (i.e. I had written the code correctly from the start), but I couldn't figure out how to view the data frames within a list so that the row names would be visible.\n\n  - Additionally, the primary problem was that I wanted row names written in the output files. I in the `write.csv()`, I had the argument `row.names = FALSE`!
