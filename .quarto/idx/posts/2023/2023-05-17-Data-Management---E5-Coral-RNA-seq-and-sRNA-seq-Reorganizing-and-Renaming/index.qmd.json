The data required some reorganization, as the project included data from three different species (_Acropora pulchra_, _Pocillopora meandrina_, and _Porites evermanni_). Additionally, since the project was sequencing the same exact samples with both RNA-seq and sRNA-seq, the resulting FastQ files ended up being the same. This fact seemed like it could lead to potential downstream mistakes and/or difficulty tracking whether or not someone was actually using an RNA-seq or an sRNA-seq FastQ.\n\nWith all of this in mind, I performed the following tasks:\n\n- Copied and renamed RNA/sRNA-seq FastQs by appending `RNA` or `sRNA` to the beginning of FastQ filenames. I also retained the original FastQ files. NOTE: The renaming process does _not_ alter the MD5 checksum, so the renamed files can still be \"tracked\" by comparing checksums with the originals if needed.\n\n- Created species directories on Owl.\n\n- Created Azenta project subdirectories within each species directory.\n\n- Updated [`Nightingales`](https://b.link/nightingales) (Google Sheet) database\n\n\n---\n\n\nOutput folders:\n\n- [https://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/A_pulchra/30-789513166/](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/A_pulchra/30-789513166/)\n\n- [https://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/A_pulchra/30-852430235/](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/A_pulchra/30-852430235/)\n\n- [https://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/P_meandrina/30-789513166/](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/P_meandrina/30-789513166/)\n\n- [https://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/P_meandrina/30-852430235/](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/P_meandrina/30-852430235/)\n\n- [https://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/P_evermanni/30-789513166/](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/P_evermanni/30-789513166/)\n\n- [https://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/P_evermanni/30-852430235/](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/P_evermanni/30-852430235/)\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\nDownloaded the E5 coral sRNA-seq data from Azenta project 30-852430235 on [20230515](../2023-05-15-Data-Received---Coral-sRNA-seq-Data-from-Azenta-Project-30-852430235/index.qmd) and the E5 coral RNA-seq data from Azenta project 30-789513166  on [20230516](../2023-05-16-Data-Received---Coral-RNA-seq-Data-from-Azenta-Project-30-789513166/index.qmd).
