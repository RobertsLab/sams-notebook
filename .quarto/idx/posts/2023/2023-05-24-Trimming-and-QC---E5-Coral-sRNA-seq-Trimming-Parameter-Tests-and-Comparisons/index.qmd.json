As an aside, I might begin using this trimmer instead of [`fastp`](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp) going forward. [`fastp`](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp) has some odd \"quirks\" in it's order of operations that sometimes require two rounds of trimming. Also, it's annoying that [`fastp`](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp) limits the number of threads to 16; [`flexbar`](https://github.com/seqan/flexbar) has no such limitation. Perhaps this is moot, as I'm not sure if there's truly a performance increase or not. The biggest trade off, though, is that [`fastp`](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp) automatically generates HTML reports for trimming, which include pre- and post-trimming plots/data.
