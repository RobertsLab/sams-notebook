The grey goo was transferred to a clean tube. An additional 500uL of isopropanol was added to the clear supernatant of two samples (#140 & #142), as well as to the grey goo. The addition of isopropanol to the clear supe resulted in an immediate precipitation of white salt-like material. The isopropanol appeared to have no effect on the grey goo.
