I needed/wanted to create a file containing gene IDs, SwissProt (SP) IDs, gene names, gene descriptions, and gene ontology (GO) accessions. To do so, I utilized the NCBI BLAST and DIAMOND BLAST annotations generated by our [GenSas _P.generosa_ genome annotation](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/posts/2019/2019-09-28-Genome-Annotation---Pgenerosa_v074-a4-Using-GenSAS/). Per Steven's suggestion, I used the best match (i.e. lowest `e-value`) for any given gene between the two files.\n\nAfter doing that, I used the SPIDs to perform a batch retrieval from [UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org/) databases. This batch retrieval pulls down a lengthy annotation file which needed to be parsed to retrieve just the info we want for each SPID. The desired info was then joined with the list of [_Panopea generosa_ (Pacific geoduck)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoduck) genes and the corresponding SPID from the NCBI BLAST and DIAMOND BLAST annotations generated by our [GenSas _P.generosa_ genome annotation](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/posts/2019/2019-09-28-Genome-Annotation---Pgenerosa_v074-a4-Using-GenSAS/).\n\nThis data wrangling also identified 8 SPID annotations that were obsolete/deleted from UniProt or which redirect to a different SPID. Those SPIDs which are obsolete/deleted were not dealt with further. For those that redirect to a different SPID, the notebook was run to identify these SPIDs and then modified to update the SPID list with these new SPIDs. The notebook was then run a second time to incorporate these updated SPIDs.\n\nThe output file is tab-delimited, with the following columns:\n\n- `gene_ID`: Gene ID from our [_Panopea generosa_ (Pacific geoduck)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoduck) genome.\n\n- `SPIDs`: Comma-delimited list of SPIDs from UniProt.
