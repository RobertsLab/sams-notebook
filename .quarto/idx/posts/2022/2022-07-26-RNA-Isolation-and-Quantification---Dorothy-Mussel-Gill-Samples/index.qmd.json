Small portions of frozen gill tissue were removed from tubes, placed in RNAzol RT and immediately homoegnized. Forceps were rinsed in distilled H<sub>2</sub>O, soaked in 10% bleach solution for 10mins, and then rinsed in distilled H<sub>2</sub>O before re-use. All centrifugation steps were performed at 16,000g for 1.5mins. Here's a brief overview of the process.\n\nTissues were homogenized in 500uL of RNAzol RT with \"disposable\" platic mortar/pestle tubes (1.5mL). After homogenization, an additional 500uL of RNAzol RT was added to the tube, vortexed and incubated at RT for 10mins. Insoluble debris was pelleted and supernatant was transferred to a 2.0mL tube. An equal volume (1mL) of 100% ethanol was added to this supernatant and mixed thoroughly by pipetting. Direct-zol Microprep Kit protocol was followed from here on, including on-column DNase I treatment. All samples were eluted with 15uL of H<sub>2</sub>O.\n\nNOTE: T25-G utilized Direct-zol DNA/RNA Miniprep Kit (ZymoResearch), as there was insufficient columns in the microprep kit. RNA was eluted with 40uL H<sub>2</sub>O.\n\nRNA was quantified using the Roberts Lab Qubit 3.0 using the Qubit RNA High Sensitivity assay.\n\n### Reverse Transcription\n\nRNA was reverse transcribed using 150ng of total RNA from each sample using M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Promega) and oligo dT primers (Promega). All reactions were performed in standard 0.5uL snapcap microfuge tubes. \n\ncDNA calculations (Google Sheet):\n\n- [20220726-medu-cDNA_calcs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S7980PcVi-6iNP9NlqShVxZra9koeA33JwIKp3PMEmY/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nAll RNA and cDNA was stored @ -80<sup>o</sup>C in [Dorothy's -80<sup>o</sup>C Box](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iTPlCXN4X03D1XWfe_A-1zIyD7dF1tKDYvUayIayQio/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n\n---\n\n# RESULTS\n\nQubit results (Google Sheet):\n\n- [20220726_qubit_medu_gill_RNA](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FXTDEZ_t38kdsN0_I2Pry2mtMotRAPKhEvtN-4mCG4c/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n\nPrimary experiment workbork (Google Sheets):\n\n- [Mussel Experiment Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13S5opQulcaCQM8ybhY3-RIO9g8fIxx6x7oXAiI_TVKg/edit?usp=sharing)\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\nIsolated RNA from a subset of Dorothy's mussel gill samples:\n\n- T01-G\n- T02-G\n- T03-G\n- T04-G\n- T05-G\n- T06-G\n- T07-G\n- T08-G\n- T09-G\n- T10-G\n- T16-G\n- T17-G\n- T18-G\n- T19-G\n- T20-G\n- T21-G\n- T22-G\n- T23-G\n- T24-G\n- T25-G\n\n### RNA Isolation\n\nRNA was isolated using RNAzol RT and the Direct-zol RNA Microprep Kit (ZymoResearch), with the DNase I on-column treatment step.
