Had to fix some R code, as well as file formatting, bash scripts, and learning how to manipulate the `circos.conf` file.

Lots of ins and outs and what-have-yous for this thing... Will execute tomorrow when Mox is back online (offline today for maintenance).\n\n---\n\n20220912\n\n- Lab meeting.\n\n- Oyster gene expression (ceabigr) meeting with Steven & Yaamini.\n\n  - Need to [make some CIRCOS plots](https://github.com/sr320/ceabigr/issues/70)\n\n  - Need to [revist Epi-Diverse stuff and add to wiki](https://github.com/sr320/ceabigr/issues/69)\n\n- Continued work on SBATCH script for geoduck RNAseq HiSat alignments for [eventual lncRNA id](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/1434).\n\n---\n\n20220909\n\n- Science Hour and Pub-a-thon\n\n- Started working on SBATCH script for geoduck RNAseq HiSat alignments for [eventual lncRNA id](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/1434).\n\n---\n\n20220908\n\n- lab meeting\n\n- transferred data to Mox, prepared SBATCH script and trimmed geoduck RNAseq data in preparation for [identifying long non-coding RNA](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/1434)\n\n---\n\n20220907\n\n- Computer maintenance: upgraded my laptop Ubuntu virtual machine from 20.04LTS to 22.04LTS.\n\n- ProCard reconcilation.\n\n- transferred geoduck RNAseq files to Mox in preparation for long non-coding RNA identification.\n\n---\n\n20220906\n\n- Computer maintenance: backed up my laptop virtual machine (took a very long time) to my home server.\n\n- Helped with [Zach's GitHub Issue regarding PCR caps vs. films](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/1520).\n\n- Helped with [Marta's GitHub Issue with running a support script in `stacks`](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/1516#issuecomment-1238614587).\n\n- ProCard reconciliation.\n\n- Technical issue with accessing the Lab Safety Report Dashboard. Resolved late this afternoon.\n\n---\n\n20220901\n\n- Continued to mess around with [Mixomics R package tutorials](https://mixomics.org/methods/). Here's R Markdown used, as well as some of the plots that were produced (PCA and sparse PCA). Overall, sex is driving factor of differences in gene expression (FPKM) and average gene methylation.\n\nPut together a quick R Markdown doc to go through the tutorial using our gene FPKM expression data and average gene methylation data (generated by Steven):\n\n\nSome screenshots of plots generated:\n\n![PCA plot comparing impacts of average gene methylation, OA exposure, and sex. Orange shapes are males. Blue shapes are female. Circles are control water conditions. Triangles are exposed to OA water conditions. Oranges (males) are all grouped together on the left side of the PCA plot. Females are all grouped together on the right side of the PCA plot.](https://github.com/RobertsLab/sams-notebook/blob/master/images/screencaps/20220901-daily_bits-mixomics-gene_methylation-PCA.png?raw=true)\n\n![Sparse PCA plot (sPCA) comparing impacts of average gene methylation, OA exposure, and sex. Orange shapes are males. Blue shapes are female. Circles are control water conditions. Triangles are exposed to OA water conditions. Oranges (males) are all grouped together on the upper left side of the sPCA plot. Females are all grouped together on the upper right side of the sPCA plot.

All females are tightly clusterd in the lower left corner. All males are tightly clustered in the lower right
