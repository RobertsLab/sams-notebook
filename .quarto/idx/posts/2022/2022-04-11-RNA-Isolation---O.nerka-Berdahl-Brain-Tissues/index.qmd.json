The brain tissues were split into 4 equal size portions. Each portion was homogenized individually. Forceps were rinsed in distilled H2O, soaked in 10% bleach solution for 10mins, and then rinsed in distilled H2O before re-use. All centrifugation steps were performed at 16,000g for 1 min. Here’s a brief overview of the process.\n\nTubes containing tissues were allowed to thaw completely at room temperature (RT). Tissues were homogenized in 500uL of TriReagent with “disposable” platic mortar/pestle tubes (1.5mL). After homogenization, an additional 500uL of TriReagent was added to the tube, vortexed and incubated at RT for 15mins. Homogenized samples were stored over night at -20<sup>o</sup>. \n\nThe four tubes from each sample was pelleted and supernatant was transferred to a 15.0mL tube. An equal volume (4mL) of 100% ethanol was added to this supernatant and mixed thoroughly by vortexing. Direct-zol Microprep Kit protocol was followed from here on, including on-column DNase I treatment. Samples were eluted with 15uL of H2O.\n\nRNA was quantified using the Roberts Lab Qubit 3.0 using the Qubit RNA High Sensitivity assay.\n\nAll RNA was stored @ -80<sup>o</sup>C in [Sam’s RNA Box #3](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j9jm3b91IkVfG0EsSjQpR--t2R97YXEQPaOFqsOqjhc/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n---\n\n\nRaw Qubit data (Google Sheet):\n\n- [20220411-qubit-rna-oner](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WCslfKqWHNmQo5T54mIfD9T6ZCAjC2vEaHUe810OPKI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nSUMMARY TABLE:\n\n| Sample | Concentration (ng/uL) | Elution Volume (uL) | Yield (ng) |\n|--------|-----------------------|---------------------|------------|\n| 6A     | 116                   | 15                  | 1740       |\n| 7A     | 132                   | 15                  | 1980       |\n| 8A     | 120                   | 15                  | 1800       |\n| 9A     | 130                   | 15                  | 1950       |\n| 10A    | 94                    | 15                  | 1410       |\n| 11A    | 114                   | 15                  | 1710       |\n| 12A    | 80                    | 15                  | 1200       |\n| 13A    | 80.8                  | 15                  | 1212       |\n| 14A    | 74.6                  | 15                  | 1119       |\n| 15A    | 108                   | 15                  | 1620       |\n| 17A    | 138                   | 15                  | 2070       |\n| 18A    | 89                    | 15                  | 1335       |\n| 19A    | 67.6                  | 15                  | 1014       |\n| 21A    | 61.6                  | 15                  | 924        |\n| 22A    | 108                   | 15                  | 1620       |\n| 24A    | 83.8                  | 15                  | 1257       |\n| 26A    | 98.8                  | 15                  | 1482       |\n| 27A    | 110                   | 15                  | 1650       |\n| 28A    | 118                   | 15                  | 1770       |\n| 29A    | 124                   | 15                  | 1860       |\n| 30A    | 102                   | 15                  | 1530       |\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n[Steven asked that I isolate RNA from the remainder of the Berdahl brain tissue samples](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/1410) (GitHub issue).\n\nFor reference, [here's the original info provided regarding these samples](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/1307) (GitHub issue).\n\nSample labelling was as follows:\n\nNumbers refer to individuals:\n\n1-15 are territorial individuals\n\n16-30 are social individuals\n\nLetters refer to tissues:\n\n(A) brain\n(B) liver\n(C) gonads\n\nThe following brain samples were selected for RNA isolation:\n\n- 6A\n- 7A\n- 8A\n- 9A\n- 10A\n- 11A\n- 12A\n- 13A\n- 14A\n- 15A\n- 17A\n- 18A\n- 19A\n- 21A\n- 22A\n- 24A\n- 26A\n- 27A\n- 28A\n- 29A\n- 30A\n\n\nRNA was isolated using RNAzol RT (Molecular Research Center) and the Direct-zol RNA Microprep Kit (ZymoResearch), with the DNase I on-column treatment step.
