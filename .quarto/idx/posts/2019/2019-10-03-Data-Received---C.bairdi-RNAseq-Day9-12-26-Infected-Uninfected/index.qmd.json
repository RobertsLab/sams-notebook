Since the samples passed your standards as acceptable samples, then I don't see how the sample failure doesn't fall on your facility's shoulders. Don't get me wrong, I fully understand your point of view in that the controls worked and all that, but your facility said the samples I submitted were acceptable for sequencing, based on the standards set by your lab. Thus, our samples met the necessary requirements for processing and sequencing. Subsequent failure should no longer be relegated back to us, the customer, since you already approved the samples.\n>\n>Another point that I wanted to address was the turnaround time for this project. From initial sample drop off to data receipt was 4.5 months. After samples passed QC and were entered into the pipeline, it took 3.75 months to get data.

Again, I am happy to set up a phone call if that is easier to answer all of your questions.\n>\n>In the meantime, I'd like to apologize for the delay in your project and lack of communication. The center's turnaround time is about 10-12 weeks once samples pass QC.  That being said, we do try to get samples returned as soon as possible meaning there are times that investigators receive their samples much sooner than the 10 weeks. Conversely the turnaround time may be longer if the production queue is long.  However, that does not excuse the lack of communication and you absolutely should have been contacted.

It absolutely does not guarantee that a successful library can be made from the sample nor do we guarantee that. To ensure that a sample failure was not due to something we did we include a control sample. All of these samples were prepped with liquid handlers and again, the control and all other samples in this batch were successful indicating that the reason these samples failed was an issue with the sample.\n>\n>One main reason a sample fails to successfully generate a library is sample quality. Typically any sample with a RIN less than 7 fails initial QC. However, a bioanalyzer wasn't run since you stated \"Additionally, I just wanted to pass along the heads up that these samples will not generate a Bioanalyzer RIN. The samples we're submitting are from tanner crab and this species only generates a single rRNA band, thus, no RIN.\" and therefore quality was not assessed. This may or may not have been a contributing factor in why these samples failed.\n>\n>In regards to billing, you were quoted ~$299 per sample.  That is the cost for the entire service.  However, when Peter invoices he only bills for the portion of the service performed.

I have asked the sequencing team to top these samples off and they will be going on the sequencers today.\n>\n>Best,\n>Stephanie\n\n---\n\n\n>Sam White <samwhite@uw.edu>\n>Mon, Oct 14, 7:14 AM (11 days ago)\n>to Stephanie, Machiko, Peter\n>\n>Thanks for the update and billing clarification. The quote didn't break out individual costs of library prep/sequencing, so I just assumed it was a all/none per sample pricing scheme.\n>\n>Sorry about the confusion on the Bioanalyzer. My intent was to simply give the heads up that the samples would appear \"abnormal\" (compared to mammalian samples); not suggest they not be run. Would've been useful to see if these samples appeared different than the others.\n>\n>Anyway, thanks again for taking the time to handle my ranting and taking the time to explain what was happening here! Looking forward to the additional data.\n>\n>\n>Sam\n\n---\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../../styles.css"],"toc":true,"toc-depth":5,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
