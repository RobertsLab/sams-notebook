However, there was a fair amount of work put into using this program, so I've decided to post what I had originally written up, despite it being incomplete. It may serve as a useful reference for someone else in the lab in the future. Since this stage of analysis requires a graphical user interface, it was performed on in a dedicated `conda` envrionment for [Anvi'o](https://anvio.org/) on `swoose` and not on `Mox`. Original [Anvi'o](https://anvio.org/) database generation was [performed on 20190401](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/posts/2019/2019-04-01-Metagenomics---Taxonomic-Diversity-Comparisons-from-Geoduck-Water-with-Anvio-on-Mox/). \n\n---\n\nCheck the initial data binning:\n\n```shell\nanvi-interactive \\\n--profile-db PROFILE.db \\\n--contigs-db contigs.db \\\n--collection-name CONCOCT\n```\n\nThat generates this:\n\n![initial anvio dendrogram screencap](https://github.com/RobertsLab/sams-notebook/blob/master/images/screencaps/20190619_anvio_initial_dendrogram.png?raw=true)\n\n\n\nTable representation of initial data binning:\n\n```shell\nanvi-summarize \\\n--pan-or-profile-db PROFILE.db \\\n--contigs-db contigs.db \\\n--collection-name CONCOCT \\\n--output-dir MERGED_SUMMARY\n```\n\nThis command generates an `index.html` file (see Results section below for link) and takes ~10 minutes to complete. Here's the portion showing the binning completion/redundancy info (there's much, much more data present in that file):\n\n![initial Anvio binning table showing completion/redundancy](https://github.com/RobertsLab/sams-notebook/blob/master/images/screencaps/20190619_anvio_initial_bins_table.png?raw=true)\n\n\n\nRefine the bins:\n\n```shell\nanvi-refine \\\n--profile-db PROFILE.db \\\n--contigs-db contigs.db \\\n--collection-name CONCOCT \\\n--bin-id Bin_75\n```\n\nIn the screencap below, the region of the dendrogram marked as \"Bin_75_1\" shows a drastic difference in coverage in the MG7 track at this particular split. Additionally, looking at the quick stats shown for this newly identified bin (in the window pane to the left), one can see that Completion is now 99% and Redundancy is only 1.4%; a marked improvement on the automatic binning.\n\n![Screencap of Bin_75 refinement dendrogram](https://github.com/RobertsLab/sams-notebook/blob/master/images/screencaps/20190619_anvio_refine_bin75-01.png?raw=true)\n\n\n\nThere does appear to be a problem with the binning data, though. It appears that many bins exhibit Completion/Redundancy data of 0.00%, however clicking on that data in the summary table reveals that is incorrect:\n\n![Screencap of summary table showing incorrect Completion/Redundancy info](https://github.com/RobertsLab/sams-notebook/blob/master/images/screencaps/20190619_anvio_summarize_zero-percent-completion-problem-01.png?raw=true)\n\n\nHere's an example of what happens when refining Bin 3:\n\n![Screencap of Bin 3 refinement dendrogram showing incorrect Completion/Redundancy info](https://github.com/RobertsLab/sams-notebook/blob/master/images/screencaps/20190619_anvio_summarize_zero-percent-completion-problem-02.png?raw=true)\n\n![Screencap of Bin 3 summary table after refinement - table still shows Completion/Redundancy of 0.00% ](https://github.com/RobertsLab/sams-notebook/blob/master/images/screencaps/20190619_anvio_summarize_zero-percent-completion-problem-03.png?raw=true)\n\n![Screencap of interactive dendrogram with Bin_3_1 highlighted to show continuing display of 0.00% Completion/Redundancy](https://github.com/RobertsLab/sams-notebook/blob/master/images/screencaps/20190619_anvio_summarize_zero-percent-completion-problem-04.png?raw=true)\n\n---\n\nAh, as it turns out, this has been fixed in the \"master\" commit in Anvi'o (thanks to the Anvi'o devs for their fast responses to my questions on their [Slack channel](https://anvio.slack.com/archives/C8SFMGYF3/p1561043792054900)!!).\n\nHere's how the upgrade process went.\n\nClone current version of Anvio's GitHub repo:\n\n```shell\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/merenlab/anvio.git\n\nCreate an Anaconda environment for Anvio', using Python version 3.6.\n\nThen, activate the newly created Anaconda environment.\n\nWithin the cloned Anvi'o repo, use Python to execute the `setup.py` file.\n\nFinally, use `pip` to complete the Anvi'o installation.\n\n```shell\nconda create --yes --name anvio python=3.6\n\nconda activate anvio\n\npython setup.py\n\npip install --editable\n```\n\n---\n\nNow, we should be able to run `anvio-interactive` on the database again and get an updated version of stats for each bin:\n\n```shell\nconda activate anvio\n(anvio) sam@swoose:~/analyses/20190619_anvio$ ~/programs/anvio_git_master_bfbcbb3/bin/anvi-interactive --profile-db PROFILE.db --contigs-db contigs.db --collection-name CONCOCT\n\n\nConfig Error: The database at 'contigs.db' is outdated (its version is v12, but your anvi'o\n              installation only knows how to deal with v13). You can migrate your database\n              without losing any data using the program `anvi-migrate-db`.  \n```\n\nSo, I ran the `anvi-migrate-db` command as recommended:\n\n`~/programs/anvio_git_master_bfbcbb3/bin/anvi-migrate-db contigs.db`\n\nThis message popped up:\n\n```shell\n* The contigs database is now 13.

Basically, visually examing the coverage plots (the black histograms), along with the tree in the center of the plot. Select regions where there is a noticeable difference in magnitude of the histograms _and_ where there are distinct branches in the tree. Anvi'o practically has these already identified, but for some reason doesn't bin them separately; sometimes even when there are high Completion and low Redudnacy scores.\n\n#### Bin 46 Manual Refinement\n\n![Manual refinement of Bin 46](https://github.com/RobertsLab/sams-notebook/blob/master/images/screencaps/20190619_anvio_refine_bin46-01.png?raw=true)\n\n---\n\n#### Bin 61 Manual Refinement\n\n![Manual refinement of Bin 61](https://github.com/RobertsLab/sams-notebook/blob/master/images/screencaps/20190619_anvio_refine_bin61-01.png?raw=true)\n\n---\n\n#### Bin 68 Manual Refinement\n\n![Manual refinement of Bin 68](https://github.com/RobertsLab/sams-notebook/blob/master/images/screencaps/20190619_anvio_refine_bin68-01.png?raw=true)\n\n---\n\n#### Bin 73 Manual Refinement\n\n![Manual refinement of Bin 73](https://github.com/RobertsLab/sams-notebook/blob/master/images/screencaps/20190619_anvio_refine_bin73-01.png?raw=true)\n\n---\n\n#### Bin 74 Manual Refinement\n\n![Manual refinement of Bin 74](https://github.com/RobertsLab/sams-notebook/blob/master/images/screencaps/20190619_anvio_refine_bin74-01.png?raw=true)\n\n---\n\n#### Bin 75 Manual Refinement\n\n![Manual refinement of Bin 75](https://github.com/RobertsLab/sams-notebook/blob/master/images/screencaps/20190619_anvio_refine_bin75-01.png?raw=true)\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\nUPDATE 20220121: THIS IS AN INCOMPLETE POST AND IS ONLY POSTED FOR POSTERITY.\n\nDue to time constraints and limits on the amount of effort wanted to be put into this project, I did not proceed with a complete analysis using [Anvi'o](https://anvio.org/).
