Granted, the LSU samples are _C.virginica_, but the _C.gigas_ larvae libraries are not aligning to the [_C.gigas_ genome via standard BLASTn](../2015-04-30-blastn-c-gigas-oa-larvae-to-ensembl-1-24-blast-db/index.qmd) or using a dedicated bisulfite mapper (e.g. BS-Map). I'm currently BLASTing a de-novo assembly of the _C.gigas_ larvae OA 400ppm sequencing that Steven made against the NCBI nt DB in an attempt to assess the taxonomic distribution of the sequences we received back. I'll also try using a different bisulfite mapper, bismark, that Mackenzie Gavery has previously used and has had better results with than BS-Map.\n\n\n\n\n\n### C.gigas Heat Stress MeDIP/BS-Seq\n\n\n\nAs part of Claire's project, there's still some BS-Seq data that would be nice to have to complement [the data she generated via microarray](https://claireeolson.blogspot.com/). It would be nice to make a decision about how to proceed with the samples. However, part of our decision on how to proceed is governed by the results we get from the two projects above. Why do those two projects impact the decision(s) regarding this project? They impact this project because in the two projects above, we produced our own BS-Seq libraries. This is extremely cost effective. However, if we can't obtain usable data from doing the library preps in-house, then that means we have to use an external service provider. Using an external company to do this is significantly more expensive. Additionally, not all companies can perform bisulfite treatment, which limits our choices (and, in turn, pricing options) on where to go for sequencing.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Miscellany\n\n\n\nWhen I have some down time, I'll continue working on migrating my Wikispaces notebook to this notebook. I only have one year left to go and it'd be great is all my notebook entries were here so they'd all be tagged/categorized and, thus, be more searchable. I'd also like to work on adding README files to our plethora of electronic data folders. Having these in place will greatly facilitate the ability of people to quickly and more easily figure out what these folders contain, file formats within those folders, etc. I also have a few computing tips/tricks that I'd like to add to [our Github \"Code\" page](https://github.com/sr320/LabDocs/tree/master/code). Oh, although this isn't really lab related, I was asked to teach the Unix shell lesson (or, at least, part of it) at the next Software Carpentry Workshop that Ben Marwick is setting up at UW in early June. So, I'm thinking that I'll try to incorporate some of the data handling stuff I've been tackling in lab in to the lesson I end up teaching.
