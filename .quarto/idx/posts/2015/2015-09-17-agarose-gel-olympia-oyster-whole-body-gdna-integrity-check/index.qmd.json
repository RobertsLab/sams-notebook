I'm not up-to-date on exactly how the preservation was accomplished, but I do know that the [_Ostrea lurida_ whole body samples I previously worked with](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/posts/2014/2014-10-15-dna-isolation-olympia-oyster-populations-for-rad-sequencing/) were just masses of black when I removed them from shells/tubes for isolation. So, in that case, it wasn't terribly surprising that that the gDNA obtained from those was degraded. It should also be noted that Katherine's extraction were from whole larvae that had been stored in RNAlater. Although a direct comparison cannot be made due to the difference in developmental stage between Katherine's samples and these, it lends some evidence to the possibility that sample collection/storage is a contributor to the degraded gDNA we're obtaining from whole body oyster extractions.
