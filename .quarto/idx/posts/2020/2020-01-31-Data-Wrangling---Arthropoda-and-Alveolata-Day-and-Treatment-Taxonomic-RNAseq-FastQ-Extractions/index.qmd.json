Here's an example:\n\nR1 FastQ header:\n\n`@A00147:37:HG2WLDMXX:1:1101:5303:1000 1:N:0:AGGCGAAG+AGGCGAAG`\n\nR2 FastQ header:\n\n`@A00147:37:HG2WLDMXX:1:1101:5303:1000 2:N:0:AGGCGAAG+AGGCGAAG`\n\nHowever, the reads extracted via MEGAN have FastA headers like this:\n\n```\n>A00147:37:HG2WLDMXX:1:1101:5303:1000\nSEQUENCE1\n>A00147:37:HG2WLDMXX:1:1101:5303:1000\nSEQUENCE2\n```\n\nThose are a set of paired reads, but there's no way to distinguish between R1/R2. This may not be an issue, but I'm not sure how downstream programs (i.e. Trinity) will handle duplicate FastA IDs as inputs. To avoid any headaches, I've decided to parse out the corresponding FastQ reads which have the full header info.\n\nAnyway, here's a brief rundown of the approach:\n\n1. Create list of unique read headers from MEGAN6 FastA files.\n\n2. Use list with `seqtk` program to pull out corresponding FastQ reads from the trimmed FastQ R1 and R2 files.\n\nThe entire procedure is documented in a Jupyter Notebook below.\n\nJupyter notebook (GitHub):\n\n- [20200131_swoose_cbai_megan_day-treatment_read_extractions.ipynb](https://github.com/RobertsLab/code/blob/master/notebooks/sam/20200131_swoose_cbai_megan_day-treatment_read_extractions.ipynb)\n\n---\n\n\nOutput folders:\n\n- [20200131.C_bairdi_megan_reads](https://gannet.fish.washington.edu/Atumefaciens/20200131.C_bairdi_megan_reads/)\n\n- [20200131.Hematodinium_megan_reads/](https://gannet.fish.washington.edu/Atumefaciens/20200131.Hematodinium_megan_reads/)\n\n\nWe now have two distinct sets of RNAseq reads from _C.bairdi_ (_Arhtropoda_) and _Hematodinium_ (_Alveolata_), split by infection status and sample day! Will get some gene expression analysis going.\n\nAlso of note, and this is a nice bit of confirmation, there are no reads present in the _Hematodinium_ extractions in either of the uninfected samples (D12 or D26).
