Once the file loads, you get a nice looking taxonomic tree! From here, you can select any part of the taxonomic tree by right-clicking on the desired taxonomy and \"Extract reads...\". Here, you have the option to include \"Summarized reads\". This option allows you to extract just the reads that are part of the exact classification you've selected or all those within and \"below\" the classification you've selected (i.e. summarized reads).\n\nExtracted reads will be generated as FastA files.\n\nExample:\n\nIf you select _Arthropoda_ and _do not_ check the box for \"Summarized Reads\" you will _only get reads classified as Arthropoda_! You will not get any reads with more specific taxonomies. However, if you select _Arthropoda_ and you _do_ check the box for \"Summarized Reads\", you will get all reads classified as _Arthropoda_ _AND_ all reads in more specific taxonomic classifications, down to the species level.\n\nI will extract reads from two phyla:\n\n- _Arthropoda_ (for crabs)\n\n- _Alveolata_ (for _Hematodinium_)\n\nAfter read extractions using MEGAN6, I'll need to extract the actual reads from the trimmed FastQ files. This will actually entail extracting all trimmed reads from two different sets of RNAseq:\n\n- [20191218_cbai_fastp_RNAseq_trimming/](https://gannet.fish.washington.edu/Atumefaciens/20191218_cbai_fastp_RNAseq_trimming/)\n\n- [20200318_cbai_RNAseq_fastp_trimming/](https://gannet.fish.washington.edu/Atumefaciens/20200318_cbai_RNAseq_fastp_trimming/)\n\nIt's a bit convoluted, but I realized that the FastA headers were incomplete and did not distinguish between paired reads. Here's an example:\n\nR1 FastQ header:\n\n`@A00147:37:HG2WLDMXX:1:1101:5303:1000 1:N:0:AGGCGAAG+AGGCGAAG`\n\nR2 FastQ header:\n\n`@A00147:37:HG2WLDMXX:1:1101:5303:1000 2:N:0:AGGCGAAG+AGGCGAAG`\n\nHowever, the reads extracted via MEGAN have FastA headers like this:\n\n```\n>A00147:37:HG2WLDMXX:1:1101:5303:1000\nSEQUENCE1\n>A00147:37:HG2WLDMXX:1:1101:5303:1000\nSEQUENCE2\n```\n\nThose are a set of paired reads, but there's no way to distinguish between R1/R2. This may not be an issue, but I'm not sure how downstream programs (i.e. Trinity) will handle duplicate FastA IDs as inputs. To avoid any headaches, I've decided to parse out the corresponding FastQ reads which have the full header info.\n\nHere's a brief rundown of the approach:\n\n1. Create list of unique read headers from MEGAN6 FastA files.\n\n2. Use list with `seqtk` program to pull out corresponding FastQ reads from the trimmed FastQ R1 and R2 files.\n\nThis aspect of read extractions/concatenations is documented in the following Jupyter notebook (GitHub):\n\n- [20200330_swoose_cbai_megan_read_extractions.ipynb](https://github.com/RobertsLab/code/blob/master/notebooks/sam/20200330_swoose_cbai_megan_read_extractions.ipynb)\n\n\n---\n\n\nOUTPUT FOLDERS\n\nInitial reads extracted as FastAs:\n\n- [20200323_cbai_MEGAN_read_extractions/](https://gannet.fish.washington.edu/Atumefaciens/20200323_cbai_MEGAN_read_extractions/)\n\nFastQ _C.bairdi_ read extractions:\n\n- [20200330.C_bairdi_megan_reads/](https://gannet.fish.washington.edu/Atumefaciens/20200330.C_bairdi_megan_reads)\n\nFastQ _Hematodinium_ read extractions:\n\n- [20200330.Hematodinium_megan_reads](https://gannet.fish.washington.edu/Atumefaciens/20200330.Hematodinium_megan_reads)\n\n\nThe taxonomic tree from each MEGAN6 RMA6 file is shown below. There are a couple of interesting things to notice from these:\n\n1. Some samples have a high abundance of reads assigned to _Bacteria_. My guess is that this was due to a slight misstep in sampling, leading to collecting mostly sea water instead of mostly hemolymph. I say this because in these samples, there are still a large amount of _Arthropoda_ reads, so it's clear that some hemolymph was collected.\n\n2. Most samples which should have reads assigned to _Hematodinium_ ([18 samples were considered \"infected\" via qPCR](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hXMY1rg5qYNTsqvO7PXbRgM7LF06ntEp27N2Efc9gSo/edit?usp=sharing)) do not have _any_ reads assigned. In fact, only four samples ended up having _Hematodinium_ reads extracted:\n\n- 132\n\n- 178\n\n- 349\n\n- 485\n\nAt this point in time, it's not that big of a deal, since we're currently just using this data to create an updated transcriptome for each of the two phyla.\n\n3. Many (most?) of the samples had a relatively high abundance of reads assigned to a microsporidian, _Enterospora canceri_, a known crab parasite. This is intriguing and not entirely sure what the implications are for analyzing the crab gene expression are. Also, it might be interesting to try to extract these reads and assemble a _Enterospora canceri_ transcriptome...\n\nNext up, creating some updated transcriptome assemblies/annotations for these two phyla.\n\n---\n\n#### Taxonomic Trees\n\n##### 113\n\n![113 MEGAN6 taxonomic tree](https://github.com/RobertsLab/sams-notebook/blob/master/images/screencaps/20200323_cbai_MEGAN_read_extractions_113.png?raw=true)\n\n---\n\n##### 118\n\n![118 MEGAN6 taxonomic tree](https://github.com/RobertsLab/sams-notebook/blob/master/images/screencaps/20200323_cbai_MEGAN_read_extractions_118.png?raw=true)\n\n---\n\n##### 127\n\n![127 MEGAN6 taxonomic tree](https://github.com/RobertsLab/sams-notebook/blob/master/images/screencaps/20200323_cbai_MEGAN_read_extractions_127.png?raw=true)\n\n---\n\n##### 132\n\n![132 MEGAN6 taxonomic tree](https://github.com/RobertsLab/sams-notebook/blob/master/images/screencaps/20200323_cbai_MEGAN_read_extractions_132.png?raw=true)\n\n---\n\n##### 151\n\n![151 MEGAN6 taxonomic tree](https://github.com/RobertsLab/sams-notebook/blob/master/images/screencaps/20200323_cbai_MEGAN_read_extractions_151.png?raw=true)\n\n---\n\n##### 173\n\n![173 MEGAN6 taxonomic tree](https://github.com/RobertsLab/sams-notebook/blob/master/images/screencaps/20200323_cbai_MEGAN_read_extractions_173.png?raw=true)\n\n---\n\n##### 178\n\n![178 MEGAN6 taxonomic tree](https://github.com/RobertsLab/sams-notebook/blob/master/images/screencaps/20200323_cbai_MEGAN_read_extractions_178.png?raw=true)\n\n---\n\n##### 221\n\n![221 MEGAN6 taxonomic tree](https://github.com/RobertsLab/sams-notebook/blob/master/images/screencaps/20200323_cbai_MEGAN_read_extractions_221.png?raw=true)\n\n---\n\n##### 222\n\n![222 MEGAN6 taxonomic tree](https://github.com/RobertsLab/sams-notebook/blob/master/images/screencaps/20200323_cbai_MEGAN_read_extractions_222.png?raw=true)\n\n---\n\n##### 254\n\n![254 MEGAN6 taxonomic tree](https://github.com/RobertsLab/sams-notebook/blob/master/images/screencaps/20200323_cbai_MEGAN_read_extractions_254.png?raw=true)\n\n---\n\n##### 272\n\n![272 MEGAN6 taxonomic tree](https://github.com/RobertsLab/sams-notebook/blob/master/images/screencaps/20200323_cbai_MEGAN_read_extractions_272.png?raw=true)\n\n---\n\n##### 280\n\n![280 MEGAN6 taxonomic tree](https://github.com/RobertsLab/sams-notebook/blob/master/images/screencaps/20200323_cbai_MEGAN_read_extractions_280.png?raw=true)\n\n---\n\n##### 294\n\n![294 MEGAN6 taxonomic tree](https://github.com/RobertsLab/sams-notebook/blob/master/images/screencaps/20200323_cbai_MEGAN_read_extractions_294.png?raw=true)\n\n---\n\n##### 334\n\n![334 MEGAN6 taxonomic tree](https://github.com/RobertsLab/sams-notebook/blob/master/images/screencaps/20200323_cbai_MEGAN_read_extractions_334.png?raw=true)\n\n---\n\n##### 349\n\n![349 MEGAN6 taxonomic tree](https://github.com/RobertsLab/sams-notebook/blob/master/images/screencaps/20200323_cbai_MEGAN_read_extractions_349.png?raw=true)\n\n---\n\n##### 359\n\n![359 MEGAN6 taxonomic tree](https://github.com/RobertsLab/sams-notebook/blob/master/images/screencaps/20200323_cbai_MEGAN_read_extractions_359.png?raw=true)\n\n---\n\n##### 425\n\n![425 MEGAN6 taxonomic tree](https://github.com/RobertsLab/sams-notebook/blob/master/images/screencaps/20200323_cbai_MEGAN_read_extractions_425.png?raw=true)\n\n---\n\n##### 427\n\n![427 MEGAN6 taxonomic tree](https://github.com/RobertsLab/sams-notebook/blob/master/images/screencaps/20200323_cbai_MEGAN_read_extractions_427.png?raw=true)\n\n---\n\n##### 445\n\n![445 MEGAN6 taxonomic tree](https://github.com/RobertsLab/sams-notebook/blob/master/images/screencaps/20200323_cbai_MEGAN_read_extractions_445.png?raw=true)\n\n---\n\n##### 463\n\n![463 MEGAN6 taxonomic tree](https://github.com/RobertsLab/sams-notebook/blob/master/images/screencaps/20200323_cbai_MEGAN_read_extractions_463.png?raw=true)\n\n---\n\n##### 481\n\n![481 MEGAN6 taxonomic tree](https://github.com/RobertsLab/sams-notebook/blob/master/images/screencaps/20200323_cbai_MEGAN_read_extractions_481.png?raw=true)\n\n---\n\n##### 485\n\n![485 MEGAN6 taxonomic tree](https://github.com/RobertsLab/sams-notebook/blob/master/images/screencaps/20200323_cbai_MEGAN_read_extractions_485.png?raw=true)\n\n---\n\n##### 72\n\n![72 MEGAN6 taxonomic tree](https://github.com/RobertsLab/sams-notebook/blob/master/images/screencaps/20200323_cbai_MEGAN_read_extractions_72.png?raw=true)\n\n---\n\n##### 73\n\n![73 MEGAN6 taxonomic tree](https://github.com/RobertsLab/sams-notebook/blob/master/images/screencaps/20200323_cbai_MEGAN_read_extractions_73.png?raw=true)\n\n---\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n[I previously annotated reads and converted them to the MEGAN6 format RMA6 on 20200318](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/posts/2020/2020-03-18-Transcriptome-Annotation---C.bairdi-Using-DIAMOND-BLASTx-on-Mox-and-MEGAN6-Meganizer-on-swoose/).\n\nI'll use the MEGAN6 GUI to \"Open\" the RMA6 file.
