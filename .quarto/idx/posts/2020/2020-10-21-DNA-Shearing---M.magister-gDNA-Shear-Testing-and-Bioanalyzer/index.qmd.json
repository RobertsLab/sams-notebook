The DNA was isolated from juvenile (J6/J7 developmental stages) gill tissue. One of the first steps in MBD-BSseq is to fragment DNA to a desired size (~350 - 500bp in our case). However, we haven't worked with _Metacarcinus magister_ DNA previously, so I need to empirically determine sonicator (Bioruptor 300; Diagenode) settings for these samples.\n\nI used 1ug of DNA in a volume of 50uL, using 0.65mL prelubricated snap cap tubes (Costar; Cat# 3206).\n\nInitially, I did a 35 cycle (30s ON, 30s OFF; low intensity setting) run and determined it was insufficient, so ran increments of 5 cycles and pulled out 1.5uL after each one to run on the Bioanalyzer.\n\nPost-sonication/shearing, samples were run on High Sensitivity DNA Assay chips in the Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent).\n\n\n---\n\n\nOutput folder/files:\n\n- [20201021_mmag_bioanalyzer/](https://gannet.fish.washington.edu/Atumefaciens/20201021_mmag_bioanalyzer/)\n\n  - Bioanalyzer files (XAD; require 2100 Expert software to open)\n\n\t  - [2100 expert_High Sensitivity DNA Assay_DE72902486_2020-10-21_07-26-05.xad](https://gannet.fish.washington.edu/Atumefaciens/20201021_mmag_bioanalyzer/2100 expert_High Sensitivity DNA Assay_DE72902486_2020-10-21_07-26-05.xad)\n\n    - [2100 expert_High Sensitivity DNA Assay_DE72902486_2020-10-21_08-23-22.xad](https://gannet.fish.washington.edu/Atumefaciens/20201021_mmag_bioanalyzer/2100 expert_High Sensitivity DNA Assay_DE72902486_2020-10-21_08-23-22.xad)\n\n    - [2100 expert_High Sensitivity DNA Assay_DE72902486_2020-10-21_09-50-46.xad](https://gannet.fish.washington.edu/Atumefaciens/20201021_mmag_bioanalyzer/2100 expert_High Sensitivity DNA Assay_DE72902486_2020-10-21_09-50-46.xad)\n\n##### Quick summary: Potentially need to cycle for 70 cycles (!!!!) to achieve desired average fragment length.\n\nWill test an uninterrupted run tomorrow to confirm that these settings are accurate.\n\n\nBelow are all of the electropherograms from each of the total cycles the CHO5-21 gDNA was subjected to: 35 - 80 cycles, increments of 5 cycles.
