- Continued tweaking containerization testing.

- Science Hour

  - Steven at the hatchery.

- Pub-a-thon

  - Discussed bisulfite SNP analysis in more detail. `EpiDiverse/snp` pipeline might not be identifying `C > T` SNPs like we want... Or, _is_ that what we want?? Turns out `EpiDiverse/snp` masks bisulfite conversions to allow for "normal" SNP analysis without the confounding factor of bisulfite conversions...

- Worked on containerization.

- Spent most of the day thinking/messing around with bisulfite SNP calls. Even [started a GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/discussions/1649).

- [Installed `ngsTools` on Raven.](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/1645) (GitHub Issue)

- Lab Meeting

  - Chris discussed eDNA project for the summer course she's running.

- CEABIGR meeting:

  - Discussed/examined how to convert VCF to GLF (genome likelihood file).

- Submitted E5 _P.verrucosa_ Hisat2/StringTie/lncRNA script using older version of StringTie to avoid segmentation fault.
