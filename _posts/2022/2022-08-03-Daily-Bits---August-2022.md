- Read Fresh Banana Leaves Ch. 8 for lab meeting.

- Lab meeting.

- Oyster gene expression meeting. Played with methylation percentages and grouping by data in R with Steven (he did most of the playing around in R).

20220805

- Messed around with Dorothy's data with Steven (he did most of the messing around) during Science Hour.

- Chatted with Zack regarding aligning data for identification of lncRNAs. Showed him the basic HiSat2 indexing/aligning options.

- Chatted with Zack regarding mussel primers from that FISH541 class. Told him to re-run class samples with primers - most failures during class likely due to inexperience with bench work.
