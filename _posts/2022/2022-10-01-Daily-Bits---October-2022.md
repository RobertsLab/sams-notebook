- Worked a a lot on CEABIGR data.

  - Reviewing predominant isoform data, to help clarify some questions Yaamini had.

  - Working on Circos plots; specifically to try to generate something "pretty" for Yaamini to use in her talk at EPIMAR tomorrow.

  - Migrating, and updating, code/data from [2018_L18-adult-methylation repo](https://github.com/epigeneticstoocean/2018_L18-adult-methylation) to CEABIGR repo. Annoying trying to keep track of which scripts/code is in which repo...

- Pub-a-thon

- Continued reorganization of Circos directories within the CEABIGR repo.

- Dealt with weird computer issues throughout the day (VMware Player kept freezing over and over). Potentially resolved by reducing number of CPUs that VM can use?
