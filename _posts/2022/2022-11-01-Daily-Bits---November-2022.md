- Finished updating the Ballgown Rmd script for CEABIGR repo.

  - Updated corresponding REAMDE(s) with file descriptions for output(s) from Rmd.

- Possibly fixed `owl/nightingales` Synology Glacier backup. Existing Glacier backup was consistently failing immediately with unhelpful log message.

  - Created new backup task.

    - US West (Oregon).

    - New key/private key for Amazon AWS Glacier vault.

    - Task is running and has backed up ~265GB so far (out of 13.03TB). Will monitor progress over the next couple of weeks/months.

- Worked on CEABIGR manuscript.
